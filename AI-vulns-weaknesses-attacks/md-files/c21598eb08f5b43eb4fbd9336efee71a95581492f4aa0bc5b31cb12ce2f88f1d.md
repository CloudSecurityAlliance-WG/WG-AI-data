CWE-1102: Reliance on Machine-Dependent Data Representation
Weakness ID: 1102
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code uses a data representation that relies on low-level data representation or constructs that may vary across dif ferent
processors, physical machines, OSes, or other physical components.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain and/or port the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or
time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name

MemberOf 1006 Bad Coding Practices
 Common Consequences

Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
