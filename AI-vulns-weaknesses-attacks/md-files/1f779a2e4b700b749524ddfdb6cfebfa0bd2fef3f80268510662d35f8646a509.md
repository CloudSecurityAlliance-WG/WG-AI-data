CWE-144: Improper Neutralization of Line Delimiters

View customized information:
 Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that
could be interpreted as line delimiters when they are sent to a downstream component.
 Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected/absent/malformed delimiter may cause the process to take unexpected actions.

Reference Description
CVE-2002-0267 Linebreak in field of PHP script allows admin privileges when written to data file.
 Potential Mitigations
Developers should anticipate that line delimiters will be injected/removed/manipulated in the input vectors of their product. Use
an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the
system.
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy , i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that
strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something
that does.
When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of
acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an
example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not
valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."
Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input,
especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However ,
denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected
outright.

3/7/24, 2:50 PM CWE - CWE-144: Improper Neutralization of Line Delimiters (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/144.html 2/2While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together , sometimes it
may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most
conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is
not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in
quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection ( CWE-88 ).
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
Depending on the language and syntax being used, this could be the same as the record delimiter ( CWE-143 ).
