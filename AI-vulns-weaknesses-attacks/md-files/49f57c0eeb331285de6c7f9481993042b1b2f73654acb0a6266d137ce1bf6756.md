CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication
Weakness ID: 304
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product implements an authentication technique, but it skips a step that weakens the technique.
 Extended Description
Authentication techniques should follow the algorithms that define them exactly , otherwise authentication can be bypassed or more
easily subjected to brute force attacks.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access Control
Integrity
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity; Read Application Data; Execute
Unauthorized Code or Commands
This weakness can lead to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors, possibly
providing attackers with sensitive information or allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2004-2163 Shared secret not verified in a RADIUS response packet, allowing authentication bypass by spoofing
server replies.
CVE-2005-3327 Chain: Authentication bypass by skipping the first startup step as required by the protocol.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
