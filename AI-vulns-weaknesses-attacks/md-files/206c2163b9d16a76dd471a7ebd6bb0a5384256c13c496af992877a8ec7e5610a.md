CWE-578: EJB Bad Practices: Use of Class Loader
Weakness ID: 578
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using the class loader .
 Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure
that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container . In this case, the product violates the following EJB
guideline: "The enterprise bean must not attempt to create a class loader; obtain the current class loader; set the context class loader;
set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the JVM; or change the input, output, and error streams." The specification
justifies this requirement in the following way: "These functions are reserved for the EJB container . Allowing the enterprise bean to
use these functions could compromise security and decrease the container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment."

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following Java example is a simple stateless Enterprise JavaBean that retrieves the interest rate for the number of points for a
mortgage. The interest rates for various points are retrieved from an XML document on the local file system, and the EJB uses the
Class Loader for the EJB class to obtain the XML document from the local file system as an input stream.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/578.html 2/2This use of the Java Class Loader class within any kind of Enterprise JavaBean violates the restriction of the EJB specification
against obtaining the current class loader as this could compromise the security of the application using the EJB.
Example 2
An EJB is also restricted from creating a custom class loader and creating a class and instance of a class from the class loader , as
shown in the following example.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Do not use the Class Loader when writing EJBs.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
