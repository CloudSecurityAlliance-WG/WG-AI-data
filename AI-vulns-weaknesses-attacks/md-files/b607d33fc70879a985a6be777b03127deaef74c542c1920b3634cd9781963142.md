CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Weakness ID: 693
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides suf ficient defense against directed attacks against
the product.
 Extended Description
This weakness covers three distinct situations. A "missing" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any
mechanism against a certain class of attack. An "insuf ficient" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example,
against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally , an "ignored" mechanism occurs
when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

 Notes
Research Gap
The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied
comprehensively . It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly dif ferent types of weaknesses than the
weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.
