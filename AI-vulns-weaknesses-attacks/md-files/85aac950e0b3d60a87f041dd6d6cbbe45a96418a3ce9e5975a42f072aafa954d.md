View customized information:
 Description
The product attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but it calls the wrong release function or calls the appropriate
release function incorrectly .
 Extended Description
This weakness can take several forms, such as:
The memory was allocated, explicitly or implicitly , via one memory management method and deallocated using a dif ferent,
non-compatible function ( CWE-762 ).
The function calls or memory management routines chosen are appropriate, however they are used incorrectly , such as in
CWE-761 .

ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Modify Memory; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
This weakness may result in the corruption of memory , and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to
a crash. If the corrupted memory can be ef fectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary
code.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This code attempts to tokenize a string and place it into an array using the strsep function, which inserts a \0 byte in place of
whitespace or a tab character . After finishing the loop, each string in the AP array points to a location within the input string.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/763.html 2/5Since strsep is not allocating any new memory , freeing an element in the middle of the array is equivalent to free a pointer in the
middle of inputstring.
Example 2
This example allocates a BarObj object using the new operator in C++, however , the programmer then deallocates the object using
free(), which may lead to unexpected behavior .
Instead, the programmer should have either created the object with one of the malloc family functions, or else deleted the object with
the delete operator .
Example 3
In this example, the programmer dynamically allocates a buf fer to hold a string and then searches for a specific character . After
completing the search, the programmer attempts to release the allocated memory and return SUCCESS or F AILURE to the caller .
Note: for simplification, this example uses a hard-coded "Search Me!" string and a constant string length of 20.
However , if the character is not at the beginning of the string, or if it is not in the string at all, then the pointer will not be at the start of
the buf fer when the programmer frees it.
Instead of freeing the pointer in the middle of the buf fer, the programmer can use an indexing pointer to step through the memory or
abstract the memory calculations by using array indexing./.../

Consider the following code in the context of a parsing application to extract commands out of user data. The intent is to parse each
command and add it to a queue of commands to be executed, discarding each malformed entry .
While the above code attempts to free memory associated with bad commands, since the memory was all allocated in one chunk, it
must all be freed together .
One way to fix this problem would be to copy the commands into a new memory location before placing them in the queue. Then,
after all commands have been processed, the memory can safely be freed.char \*str;
int i = 0;
str = (char\*)malloc(20\*sizeof(char));
strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
while( i < strlen(str) ){
if( str[i] == c ){
/\* matched char, free string and return success \*/
free(str);
return SUCCESS;
}
/\* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char \*/
i = i + 1;
}
/\* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure \*/
free(str);
return FAILURE;

//hardcode input length for simplicity
char\* input = (char\*) malloc(40\*sizeof(char));
char \*tok;
char\* sep = " \t";
get\_user\_input( input );
/\* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string \*/
tok = strtok( input, sep);
while( NULL != tok ){
if( isMalformed( tok ) ){
/\* ignore and discard bad data \*/
free( tok );

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-11930 function "internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buf fer. This led
to freeing invalid memory ."
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Only call matching memory management functions. Do not mix and match routines. For example, when you allocate a buf fer
with malloc(), dispose of the original pointer with free().
Phase: Implementation
When programming in C++, consider using smart pointers provided by the boost library to help correctly and consistently
manage memory .
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks
Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness
easier to avoid.
For example, glibc in Linux provides protection against free of invalid pointers.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a language that provides abstractions for memory allocation and deallocation.
Phase: T esting
Use a tool that dynamically detects memory management problems, such as valgrind.
 Detection Methods
Fuzzing
Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
The view-1000 subtree that is associated with this weakness needs additional work. Several entries will likely be created in this
branch. Currently the focus is on free() of memory , but delete and other related release routines may require the creation of
