CWE-1061: Insufficient Encapsulation
Weakness ID: 1061
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not suf ficiently hide the internal representation and implementation details of data or methods, which might allow
external components or modules to modify data unexpectedly , invoke unexpected functionality , or introduce dependencies that the
programmer did not intend.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-consuming
to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example shows a basic user account class that includes member variables for the username and password as well as a
public constructor for the class and a public method to authorize access to the user account.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1061.html 2/2However , the member variables username and password are declared public and therefore will allow access and changes to the
member variables to anyone with access to the object. These member variables should be declared private as shown below to
prevent unauthorized access and changes.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2010-3860 variables declared public allow remote read of system properties such as user name and home
directory .
