CWE-583: finalize() Method Declared Public
Weakness ID: 583
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product violates secure coding principles for mobile code by declaring a finalize() method public.
 Extended Description
A product should never call finalize explicitly , except to call super .finalize() inside an implementation of finalize(). In mobile code
situations, the otherwise error prone practice of manual garbage collection can become a security threat if an attacker can maliciously
invoke a finalize() method because it is declared with public access.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following Java Applet code mistakenly declares a public finalize() method.
Mobile code, in this case a Java Applet, is code that is transmitted across a network and executed on a remote machine. Because
mobile code developers have little if any control of the environment in which their code will execute, special security concerns become
relevant. One of the biggest environmental threats results from the risk that the mobile code will run side-by-side with other , potentially
malicious, mobile code. Because all of the popular web browsers execute code from multiple sources together in the same JVM,
many of the security guidelines for mobile code are focused on preventing manipulation of your objects' state and behavior by
adversaries who have access to the same virtual machine where your product is running.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
If you are using finalize() as it was designed, there is no reason to declare finalize() with anything other than protected access.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/583.html 2/2Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
