Weakness ID: 54
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of trailing backslash ('filedir\') without appropriate validation, which can lead to ambiguous
path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

Reference Description
CVE-2004-0847 web framework for .NET allows remote attackers to bypass authentication for .aspx files in restricted
directories via a request containing a (1) "\" (backslash) or (2) "%5C" (encoded backslash)
CVE-2004-0061 Bypass directory access restrictions using trailing dot in URL
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
