unintended or unanticipated behavior . The weakness in the system can be a bug, a
glitch, or a design vulnerability . These applications are often websites, but can
include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device
administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any
other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and
related services.
