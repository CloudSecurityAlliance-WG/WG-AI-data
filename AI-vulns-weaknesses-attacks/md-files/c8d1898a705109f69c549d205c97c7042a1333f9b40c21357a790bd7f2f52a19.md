 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Unexpected State
Unchecked input leads to cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection vulnerabilities, among
others.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use the ASP.NET validation framework to check all program input before it is processed by the application. Example uses of the
validation framework include checking to ensure that:
Phone number fields contain only valid characters in phone numbers
Boolean values are only "T" or "F"
Free-form strings are of a reasonable length and composition
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/554.html 2/2Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
