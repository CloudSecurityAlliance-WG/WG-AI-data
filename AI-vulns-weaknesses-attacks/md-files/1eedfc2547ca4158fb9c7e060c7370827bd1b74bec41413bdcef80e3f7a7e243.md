https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/755.html 2/3The following example attempts to allocate memory for a character . After the call to malloc, an if statement is used to check whether
the malloc function failed.
The conditional successfully detects a NULL return value from malloc indicating a failure, however it does not do anything to handle
the problem. Unhandled errors may have unexpected results and may cause the program to crash or terminate.
Instead, the if block should contain statements that either attempt to fix the problem or notify the user that an error has occurred and
continue processing or perform some cleanup and gracefully terminate the program. The following example notifies the user that the
malloc function did not allocate the required memory resources and returns an error code.
Example 3
The following code mistakenly catches a NullPointerException.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2023-41151 SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked
for writing but the server tries to send an error
Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function
instead of reporting a failure ( CWE-392 ), thus reducing the entropy ( CWE-332 ) and leading to
generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets ( CWE-1391 )
CVE-2021-3011 virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid
value to a register , which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code
CVE-2008-4302 Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call ( CWE-755 ), leading to an unlock
of a resource that was not locked ( CWE-832 ), with resultant crash.
