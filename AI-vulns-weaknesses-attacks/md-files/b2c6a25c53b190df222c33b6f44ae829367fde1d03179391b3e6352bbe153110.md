View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a data element that has an excessively large number of sub-elements with non-primitive data types such as
structures or aggregated objects.
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this performance problem
might introduce a vulnerability .
While the interpretation of "excessively large" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ recommends a default of 5 sub-
elements.
