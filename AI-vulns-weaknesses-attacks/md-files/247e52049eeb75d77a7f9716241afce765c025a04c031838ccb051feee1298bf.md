https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3134600.3134635 2/12Fueled by massive amounts of data, models produced by machine-learning (ML) algorithms are being used
in diverse domains where security is a concern, such as, automotive systems, finance, health-care,
computer vision, speech recognition, natural-language processing, and malware detection. Of particular
concern is use of ML in cyberphysical systems, such as driver-less cars and aviation, where the presence
of an adversary can cause serious consequences. In this paper we focus on attacks caused by adversarial
samples, which are inputs crafted by adding small, often imperceptible, perturbations to force a ML model
to misclassify . We present a simple gradient-descent based algorithm for finding adversarial samples,
which performs well in comparison to existing algorithms. The second issue that this paper tackles is that of
metrics. W e present a novel metric based on few computer-vision algorithms for measuring the quality of
adversarial samples.
