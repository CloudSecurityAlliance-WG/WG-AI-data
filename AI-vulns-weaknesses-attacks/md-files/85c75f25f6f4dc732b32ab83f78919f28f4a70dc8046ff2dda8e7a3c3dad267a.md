CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information
Weakness ID: 1295
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product fails to adequately prevent the revealing of unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information within debugging
messages.
 Extended Description
Debug messages are messages that help troubleshoot an issue by revealing the internal state of the system. For example, debug
data in design can be exposed through internal memory array dumps or boot logs through interfaces like UAR T via TAP commands,
scan chain, etc. Thus, the more information contained in a debug message, the easier it is to debug. However , there is also the risk of
revealing information that could help an attacker either decipher a vulnerability , and/or gain a better understanding of the system.
Thus, this extra information could lower the "security by obscurity" factor . While "security by obscurity" alone is insuf ficient, it can help
as a part of "Defense-in-depth".

3/7/24, 2:48 PM CWE - CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1295.html 2/2Example 1: Suppose in response to a Test Access Port (T AP) chaining request the debug message also reveals the current TAP
hierarchy (the full topology) in addition to the success/failure message.
Example 2: In response to a password-filling request, the debug message, instead of a simple Granted/Denied response, prints an
elaborate message, "The user-entered password does not match the actual password stored in ."
The result of the above examples is that the user is able to gather additional unauthorized information about the system from the
debug messages.
The solution is to ensure that Debug messages do not reveal additional details.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-25476 Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying
ASLR bypass
CVE-2020-24491 Processor generates debug message that contains sensitive information ("addresses of memory
transactions").
CVE-2017-18326 modem debug messages include cryptographic keys
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that a debug message does not reveal any unnecessary information during the debug process for the intended
response.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
