View customized information:
 Description
When multiple sockets are allowed to bind to the same port, other services on that port may be stolen or spoofed.
 Extended Description
On most systems, a combination of setting the SO\_REUSEADDR socket option, and a call to bind() allows any process to bind to a
port to which a previous process has bound with INADDR\_ANY . This allows a user to bind to the specific address of a server bound to
INADDR\_ANY on an unprivileged port, and steal its UDP packets/TCP connection.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/605.html 2/2This code may result in two servers binding a socket to same port, thus receiving each other's traf fic. This could be used by an
attacker to steal packets meant for another process, such as a secure FTP server .
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Policy
Restrict server socket address to known local addresses.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
