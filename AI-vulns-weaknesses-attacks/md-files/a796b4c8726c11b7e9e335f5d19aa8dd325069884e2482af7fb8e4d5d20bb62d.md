 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example attempts to resolve a hostname.
A DNS lookup failure will cause the Servlet to throw an exception.
Example 2
This code queries a server and displays its status when a request comes from an authorized IP address.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: Java 
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
...
out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
$requestingIP = $\_SERVER['REMOTE\_ADDR'];

$status = getServerStatus();
h$tt3/7/24, 3:08 PM CWE - CWE-705: Incorrect Control Flow Scoping (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/705.html 2/3This code redirects unauthorized users, but continues to execute code after calling http\_redirect(). This means even unauthorized
users may be able to access the contents of the page or perform a DoS attack on the server being queried. Also, note that this code is
vulnerable to an IP address spoofing attack ( CWE-212 ).
Example 3
Included in the doPost() method defined below is a call to System.exit() in the event of a specific exception.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2023-21087 Java code in a smartphone OS can encounter a "boot loop" due to an uncaught exception
CVE-2014-1266 chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-
Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561
(Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate V alidation) -> CWE-393 (Return of W rong Status
Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
