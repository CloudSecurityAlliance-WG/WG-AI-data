CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
Weakness ID: 922
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.
 Extended Description
If read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted,
then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and DesignOMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design
phase.
Implementation
System Configuration
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data; Read Files or Directories
Attackers can read sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data; Modify Files or Directories
Attackers can overwrite sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2009-2272 password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

 Notes
Relationship
There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information ( CWE-922 ) and missing encryption of
sensitive information ( CWE-311 ). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However ,
encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon
inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.
Maintenance
This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view ( CWE-1000 ). Currently , most of the
information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.
