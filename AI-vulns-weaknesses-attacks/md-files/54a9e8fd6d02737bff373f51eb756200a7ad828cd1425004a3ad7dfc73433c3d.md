CWE-181: Incorrect Behavior Order: V alidate Before Filter
Weakness ID: 181
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product validates data before it has been filtered, which prevents the product from detecting data that becomes invalid after the
filtering step.
 Extended Description
This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be
prevented, such as injection.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This script creates a subdirectory within a user directory and sets the user as the owner .
While the script attempts to screen for '..' sequences, an attacker can submit a directory path including ".~.", which will then become
".." after the filtering step. This allows a Path Traversal ( CWE-21 ) attack to occur .

(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
function createDir($userName,$dirName){
$userDir = '/users/'. $userName;
if(strpos($dirName,'..') !== false){
echo 'Directory name contains invalid sequence';
return;
}
//filter out '~' because other scripts identify user directories by this prefix
$dirName = str\_replace('~','',$dirName);
$newDir = $userDir . $dirName;
mkdir($newDir, 0700);
chown($newDir,$userName);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/181.html 2/2CVE-2002-0934 Directory traversal vulnerability allows remote attackers to read or modify arbitrary files via invalid
characters between two . (dot) characters, which are filtered and result in a ".." sequence.
CVE-2003-0282 Directory traversal vulnerability allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via invalid characters
between two . (dot) characters, which are filtered and result in a ".." sequence.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Implementation; Architecture and Design
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being filtered.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Research Gap
This category is probably under-studied.
