CWE-1120: Excessive Code Complexity
Weakness ID: 1120
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The code is too complex, as calculated using a well-defined, quantitative measure.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult
or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
This issue can make the product perform more slowly . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this performance problem
might introduce a vulnerability .
