CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
Weakness ID: 943
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or
incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query .
 Extended Description
Depending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:
Modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise
manipulated
Append additional commands to the query
Return more entities than intended
Return fewer entities than intended
Cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way
The ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. But when the product logic
depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one
entity that specifies an administrative user , but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return
information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.
While this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to
injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP , DQL, XQuery , Xpath, and "NoSQL" languages.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query
restricts the items displayed to those where owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/943.html 2/3The query that this code intends to execute follows:
However , because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the
query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character . If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the
string:
for itemName, then the query becomes the following:
The addition of the:
condition causes the WHERE clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:
This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the
authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner .
Example 2
The code below constructs an LDAP query using user input address data:
Because the code fails to neutralize the address string used to construct the query , an attacker can supply an address that includes
additional LDAP queries.
Example 3
Consider the following simple XML document that stores authentication information and a snippet of Java code that uses XPath query
to retrieve authentication information:
The Java code used to retrieve the home directory based on the provided credentials is:...
string userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();
string query = "SELECT \* FROM items WHERE owner = '" + userName + "' AND itemname = '" + ItemName.Text + "'";
sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);
DataTable dt = new DataTable();
sda.Fill(dt);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/943.html 3/3Assume that user "john" wishes to leverage XPath Injection and login without a valid password. By providing a username "john" and
password "' or ''='" the XPath expression now becomes
This lets user "john" login without a valid password, thus bypassing authentication.

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Notes
Relationship
It could be argued that data query languages are ef fectively a command language - albeit with a limited set of commands - and thus
any query-language injection issue could be treated as a child of CWE-74 . However , CWE-943 is intended to better organize query-
oriented issues to separate them from fully-functioning programming languages, and also to provide a more precise identifier for the
many query languages that do not have their own CWE identifier .
