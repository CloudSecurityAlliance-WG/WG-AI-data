CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes
('Prototype Pollution')
Weakness ID: 1321
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but
it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.
 Extended Description
By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical
attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or
uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty , toString or valueOf).
This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give
access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or
clones objects recursively .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1321.html 2/3This function does not check if the attribute resolves to the object prototype. These codes can be used to add "isAdmin: true" to the
object prototype.
By using a denylist of dangerous attributes, this weakness can be eliminated.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
By freezing the object prototype first (for example, Object.freeze(Object.prototype)), modification of the prototype becomes
impossible.
Effectiveness: High
Note: While this can mitigate this weakness completely , other methods are recommended when possible, especially in
components used by upstream software ("libraries").
Phase: Architecture and Design
By blocking modifications of attributes that resolve to object prototype, such as proto or prototype, this weakness can be
mitigated.
Effectiveness: High
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
When handling untrusted objects, validating using a schema can be used.
Effectiveness: Limited
Phase: Implementation
By using an object without prototypes (via Object.create(null) ), adding object prototype attributes by accessing the prototype via
the special attributes becomes impossible, mitigating this weakness.
Effectiveness: High
Phase: Implementation
Map can be used instead of objects in most cases. If Map methods are used instead of object attributes, it is not possible to
access the object prototype or modify it.objectToModify = objectToModify[attr];
}
objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
return object;
}
(bad code) Example Language: JavaScript 
setValueByPath({}, "\_\_proto\_\_.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
(good code) Example Language: JavaScript 
function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
const pathArray = path.split(".");
const attributeToSet = pathArray.pop();
let objectToModify = object;
for (const attr of pathArray) {
// Ignore attributes which resolve to object prototype
if (attr === "\_\_proto\_\_" || attr === "constructor" || attr === "prototype") {
continue;
}
if (typeof objectToModify[attr] !== "object") {
objectToModify[attr] = {};
}
objectToModify = objectToModify[attr];
}
objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
return object;

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
