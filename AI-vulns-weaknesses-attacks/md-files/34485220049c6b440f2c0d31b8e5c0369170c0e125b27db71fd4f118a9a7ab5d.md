CWE-622: Improper V alidation of Function Hook Arguments
Weakness ID: 622
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product adds hooks to user-accessible API functions, but it does not properly validate the arguments. This could lead to resultant
vulnerabilities.
 Extended Description
Such hooks can be used in defensive software that runs with privileges, such as anti-virus or firewall, which hooks kernel calls. When
the arguments are not validated, they could be used to bypass the protection scheme or attack the product itself.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
