CWE-460: Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception
Weakness ID: 460
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not clean up its state or incorrectly cleans up its state when an exception is thrown, leading to unexpected state or
control flow .
 Extended Description
Often, when functions or loops become complicated, some level of resource cleanup is needed throughout execution. Exceptions can
disturb the flow of the code and prevent the necessary cleanup from happening.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
If one breaks from a loop or function by throwing an exception, make sure that cleanup happens or that you should exit the
program. Use throwing exceptions sparsely .
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
