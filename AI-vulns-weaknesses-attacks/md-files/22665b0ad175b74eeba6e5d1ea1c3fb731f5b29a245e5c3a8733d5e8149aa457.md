CWE-530: Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
Weakness ID: 530
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A backup file is stored in a directory or archive that is made accessible to unauthorized actors.
 Extended Description
Often, older backup files are renamed with an extension such as .~bk to distinguish them from production files. The source code for
old files that have been renamed in this manner and left in the webroot can often be retrieved. This renaming may have been
performed automatically by the web server , or manually by the administrator .
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
 Relevant to the view "Architectural Concepts" (CWE-1008)
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Operation OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
At a minimum, an attacker who retrieves this file would have all the information contained in it,
whether that be database calls, the format of parameters accepted by the application, or simply
information regarding the architectural structure of your site.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Policy
Recommendations include implementing a security policy within your organization that prohibits backing up web application
source code in the webroot.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/530.html 2/2Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
