CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
Weakness ID: 1394
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality .
 Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the
system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However , if admins do not change the defaults, it is
easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

Reference Description
CVE-2018-3825 cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key
CVE-2016-1561 backup storage product has a default SSH public key in the authorized\_keys file, allowing root access
CVE-2010-2306 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and
installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Requirements
Prohibit use of default, hard-coded, or other values that do not vary for each installation of the product - especially for separate
organizations.
Effectiveness: High
Phase: Architecture and Design
Force the administrator to change the credential upon installation.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
