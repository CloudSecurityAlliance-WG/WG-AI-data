CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method W ith Sensitive Query Strings
Weakness ID: 598
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that
request.
 Extended Description
The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history , passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs,
or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers
can use this information to launch further attacks.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
At a minimum, attackers can garner information from query strings that can be utilized in escalating
their method of attack, such as information about the internal workings of the application or database
column names. Successful exploitation of query string parameter vulnerabilities could lead to an
attacker impersonating a legitimate user , obtaining proprietary data, or simply executing actions not
intended by the application developers.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-23546 A discussion platform leaks private information in GET requests.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
When sensitive information is sent, use the POST method (e.g. registration form).
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
