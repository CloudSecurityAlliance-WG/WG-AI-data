CWE-765: Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource
Weakness ID: 765
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product unlocks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system.
 Extended Description
When the product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly unlocks a critical resource, the consequences will vary
based on the type of lock, the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations such as with semaphores,
the resources are pooled and extra calls to unlock will increase the count for the number of available resources, likely resulting in a
crash or unpredictable behavior when the system nears capacity .

Reference Description
CVE-2009-0935 Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
When locking and unlocking a resource, try to be sure that all control paths through the code in which the resource is locked one
or more times correspond to exactly as many unlocks. If the product acquires a lock and then determines it is not able to perform
its intended behavior , be sure to release the lock(s) before waiting for conditions to improve. Reacquire the lock(s) before trying
again.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/765.html 2/2Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
An alternate way to think about this weakness is as an imbalance between the number of locks / unlocks in the control flow . Over the
course of execution, if each lock call is not followed by a subsequent call to unlock in a reasonable amount of time, then system
performance may be degraded or at least operating at less than peak levels if there is competition for the locks. This entry may need
to be modified to reflect these concepts in the future.
