View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of single dot directory exploit ('/./') without appropriate validation, which can lead to
ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2000-0004 Server allows remote attackers to read source code for executable files by inserting a . (dot) into the
URL.
CVE-2002-0304 Server allows remote attackers to read password-protected files via a /./ in the HTTP request.
CVE-1999-1083 Possibly (could be a cleansing error)
CVE-2004-0815 "/./////etc" cleansed to ".///etc" then "/etc"
CVE-2002-0112 Server allows remote attackers to view password protected files via /./ in the URL.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/55.html 2/2This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
