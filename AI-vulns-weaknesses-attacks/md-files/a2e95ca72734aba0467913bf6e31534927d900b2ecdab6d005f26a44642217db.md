View customized information:
 Description
The product does not exit or otherwise modify its operation when security-relevant errors occur during initialization, such as when a
configuration file has a format error or a hardware security module (HSM) cannot be activated, which can cause the product to
execute in a less secure fashion than intended by the administrator .

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data; Alter Execution Logic
The application could be placed in an insecure state that may allow an attacker to modify sensitive data or
allow unintended logic to be executed.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code intends to limit certain operations to the administrator only .
If the application is unable to extract the state information - say , due to a database timeout - then the $uid variable will not be explicitly
set by the programmer . This will cause $uid to be regarded as equivalent to "0" in the conditional, allowing the original user to perform
administrator actions. Even if the attacker cannot directly influence the state data, unexpected errors could cause incorrect privileges
to be assigned to a user just by accident.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/455.html 2/2Reference Description
CVE-2005-1345 Product does not trigger a fatal error if missing or invalid ACLs are in a configuration file.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Follow the principle of failing securely when an error occurs. The system should enter a state where it is not vulnerable and will
not display sensitive error messages to a potential attacker .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Research Gap
Under-studied. These issues are not frequently reported, and it is dif ficult to find published examples.
