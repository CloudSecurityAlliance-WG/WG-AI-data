CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code
Weakness ID: 540
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
Source code on a web server or repository often contains sensitive information and should generally not be accessible to users.
 Extended Description
There are situations where it is critical to remove source code from an area or server . For example, obtaining Perl source code on a
system allows an attacker to understand the logic of the script and extract extremely useful information such as code bugs or logins
and passwords.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code uses an include file to store database credentials:
database.inc
login.php
If the server does not have an explicit handler set for .inc files it may send the contents of database.inc to an attacker without pre-
processing, if the attacker requests the file directly . This will expose the database name and password.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
