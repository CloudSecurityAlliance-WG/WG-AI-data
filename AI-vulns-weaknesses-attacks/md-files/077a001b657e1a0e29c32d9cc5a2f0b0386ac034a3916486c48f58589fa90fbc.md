CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation
Weakness ID: 1176
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs CPU computations using algorithms that are not as ef ficient as they could be for the needs of the developer ,
i.e., the computations can be optimized further .
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly , possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users. If an attacker can influence
the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity , then this performance problem might
introduce a vulnerability .
