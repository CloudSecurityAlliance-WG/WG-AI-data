View customized information:
 Description
The product does not adequately protect confidential information on the device from being accessed by Outsourced Semiconductor
Assembly and Test (OSA T) vendors.
 Extended Description
In contrast to complete vertical integration of architecting, designing, manufacturing, assembling, and testing chips all within a single
organization, an organization can choose to simply architect and design a chip before outsourcing the rest of the process to OSA T
entities (e.g., external foundries and test houses). In the latter example, the device enters an OSA T facility in a much more vulnerable
pre-production stage where many debug and test modes are accessible. Therefore, the chipmaker must place a certain level of trust
with the OSA T. To counter this, the chipmaker often requires the OSA T partner to enter into restrictive non-disclosure agreements
(NDAs). Nonetheless, OSA T vendors likely have many customers, which increases the risk of accidental sharing of information. There
may also be a security vulnerability in the information technology (IT) system of the OSA T facility . Alternatively , a malicious insider at
the OSA T facility may carry out an insider attack. Considering these factors, it behooves the chipmaker to minimize any confidential
information in the device that may be accessible to the OSA T vendor .
Logic errors during design or synthesis could misconfigure the interconnection of the debug components, which could provide
improper authorization to sensitive information.

Availability
Accountability
Non-RepudiationThe impact depends on the confidential information itself and who is inadvertently granted access.
For example, if the confidential information is a key that can unlock all the parts of a generation,
the impact could be severe.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example shows how an attacker can take advantage of a piece of confidential information that has not been protected
from the OSA T.
Suppose the preproduction device contains NVM (a storage medium that by definition/design can retain its data without power), and
this NVM contains a key that can unlock all the parts for that generation. An OSA T facility accidentally leaks the key .
Compromising a key that can unlock all the parts of a generation can be devastating to a chipmaker .
The likelihood of such a compromise can be reduced by ensuring all memories on the preproduction device are properly scrubbed.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Ensure that when an OSA T vendor is allowed to access test interfaces necessary for preproduction and returned parts,
the vendor only pulls the minimal information necessary . Also, architect the product in such a way that, when an "unlock
device" request comes, it only unlocks that specific part and not all the parts for that product line.
Ensure that the product's non-volatile memory (NVM) is scrubbed of all confidential information and secrets before
handing it over to an OSA T.
Arrange to secure all communication between an OSA T facility and the chipmaker .
Effectiveness: Moderate
 Detection Methods
Architecture or Design Review
Appropriate Post-Si tests should be carried out to ensure that residual confidential information is not left on parts leaving one
facility for another facility .
Effectiveness: High
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
Appropriate Post-Si tests should be carried out to ensure that residual confidential information is not left on parts leaving one
facility for another facility .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
