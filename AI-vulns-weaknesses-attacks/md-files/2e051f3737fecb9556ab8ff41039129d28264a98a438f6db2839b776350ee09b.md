CWE-1070: Serializable Data Element Containing non-Serializable Item Elements
Weakness ID: 1070
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains a serializable, storable data element such as a field or member , but the data element contains member
elements that are not serializable.
 Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem
might introduce a vulnerability .
As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the
inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java.
