CWE-566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled SQL Primary Key
Weakness ID: 566
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a database table that includes records that should not be accessible to an actor , but it executes a SQL statement
with a primary key that can be controlled by that actor .
 Extended Description
When a user can set a primary key to any value, then the user can modify the key to point to unauthorized records.
Database access control errors occur when:
Data enters a program from an untrusted source.
The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query .
The untrusted source does not have the permissions to be able to access all rows in the associated table.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to
construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a
list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user .
The problem is that the developer has not considered all of the possible values of id. Although the interface generates a list of invoice
identifiers that belong to the current user , an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code inAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Assume all input is malicious. Use a standard input validation mechanism to validate all input for length, type, syntax, and
business rules before accepting the data. Use an "accept known good" validation strategy .
Phase: Implementation
Use a parameterized query AND make sure that the accepted values conform to the business rules. Construct your SQL
statement accordingly .
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
