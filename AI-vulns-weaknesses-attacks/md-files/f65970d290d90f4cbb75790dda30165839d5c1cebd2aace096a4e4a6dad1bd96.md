 Description
The hardware design control register "sticky bits" or write-once bit fields are improperly implemented, such that they can be
reprogrammed by software.
 Extended Description
Integrated circuits and hardware IP software programmable controls and settings are commonly stored in register circuits. These
register contents have to be initialized at hardware reset to define default values that are hard coded in the hardware description
language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. A common security protection method used to protect register settings from modification
by software is to make the settings write-once or "sticky ." This allows writing to such registers only once, whereupon they become
read-only . This is useful to allow initial boot software to configure systems settings to secure values while blocking runtime software
from modifying such hardware settings.
Failure to implement write-once restrictions in hardware design can expose such registers to being re-programmed by software and
written multiple times. For example, write-once fields could be implemented to only be write-protected if they have been set to value
"1", wherein they would work as "write-1-once" and not "write-once".

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Consider the example design module system verilog code shown below . register\_write\_once\_example module is an example of
register that has a write-once field defined. Bit 0 field captures the write\_once\_status value. This implementation can be for a register
that is defined by specification to be a write-once register , since the write\_once\_status field gets written by input data bit 0 on first
write.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1224.html 2/3The above example only locks further writes if write\_once\_status bit is written to one. So it acts as write\_1-Once instead of the write-
once attribute.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
During hardware design all register write-once or sticky fields must be evaluated for proper configuration.
Phase: T esting
The testing phase should use automated tools to test that values are not reprogrammable and that write-once fields lock on
writing zeros.(bad code) Example Language: Verilog 
module register\_write\_once\_example
(
input [15:0] Data\_in,
input Clk,
input ip\_resetn,
input global\_resetn,
input write,
output reg [15:0] Data\_out
);
reg Write\_once\_status;
always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip\_resetn)
if (~ip\_resetn)
begin
Data\_out <= 16'h0000;
Write\_once\_status <= 1'b0;
end
else if (write & ~Write\_once\_status)
begin
Data\_out <= Data\_in & 16'hFFFE;
Write\_once\_status <= Data\_in[0]; // Input bit 0 sets Write\_once\_status
end
else if (~write)
begin
Data\_out[15:1] <= Data\_out[15:1];
Data\_out[0] <= Write\_once\_status;
end
endmodule
(good code) Example Language: Verilog 
module register\_write\_once\_example
(
input [15:0] Data\_in,
input Clk,
input ip\_resetn,
input global\_resetn,
input write,
output reg [15:0] Data\_out
);
reg Write\_once\_status;
always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip\_resetn)
if (~ip\_resetn)
begin
Data\_out <= 16'h0000;
Write\_once\_status <= 1'b0;
end
else if (write & ~Write\_once\_status)
begin
Data\_out <= Data\_in & 16'hFFFE;
Write\_once\_status <= 1'b1; // Write once status set on first write, independent of input
end
else if (~write)
begin
Data\_out[15:1] <= Data\_out[15:1];
Data\_out[0] <= Write\_once\_status;
end

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
