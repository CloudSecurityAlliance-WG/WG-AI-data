CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
Weakness ID: 425
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.
 Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached
through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.
 Alternate T erms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use
is discouraged.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses
such as XSS and SQL injection.
Theoretical
"Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be
immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence
is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in
languages such as PHP , which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.
