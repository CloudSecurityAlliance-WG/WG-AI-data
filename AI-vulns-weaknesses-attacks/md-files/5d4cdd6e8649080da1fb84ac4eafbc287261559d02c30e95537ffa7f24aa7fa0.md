CWE-1204: Generation of W eak Initialization V ector (IV)
Weakness ID: 1204

View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization V ector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
 Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness
and/or unpredictability of an IV . Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g.
by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

the data can be leaked. See [ REF-1179 ].

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1204.html 2/3In both of these examples, the initialization vector (IV) is always a block of zeros. This makes the resulting cipher text much more
predictable and susceptible to a dictionary attack.
Example 2
The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol used in the 802.11 wireless standard only supported 40-bit keys, and the IVs were only
24 bits, increasing the chances that the same IV would be reused for multiple messages. The IV was included in plaintext as part of
the packet, making it directly observable to attackers. Only 5000 messages are needed before a collision occurs due to the "birthday
paradox" [ REF-1176 ]. Some implementations would reuse the same IV for each packet. This IV reuse made it much easier for
attackers to recover plaintext from two packets with the same IV , using well-understood attacks, especially if the plaintext was known
for one of the packets [ REF-1175 ].
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2020-1472 ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
CVE-2011-3389 BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random,
allowing decryption of HTTPS traf fic using a chosen plaintext attack.
CVE-2001-0161 wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to
decrypt traf fic
CVE-2001-0160 WEP card generates predictable IV values, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traf fic
CVE-2017-3225 device bootloader uses a zero initialization vector during AES-CBC
CVE-2016-6485 crypto framework uses PHP rand function - which is not cryptographically secure - for an initialization
vector
CVE-2014-5386 encryption routine does not seed the random number generator , causing the same initialization vector
to be generated repeatedly
CVE-2020-5408 encryption functionality in an authentication framework uses a fixed null IV with CBC mode, allowing
attackers to decrypt traf fic in applications that use this functionality
CVE-2017-17704 messages for a door-unlocking product use a fixed IV in CBC mode, which is the same after each
restart
CVE-2017-11133 application uses AES in CBC mode, but the pseudo-random secret and IV are generated using
math.random, which is not cryptographically strong.
CVE-2007-3528 Blowfish-CBC implementation constructs an IV where each byte is calculated modulo 8 instead of
modulo 256, resulting in less than 12 bits for the ef fective IV length, and less than 4096 possible IV
values.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Different cipher modes have dif ferent requirements for their IVs. When choosing and implementing a mode, it is important to
understand those requirements in order to keep security guarantees intact. Generally , it is safest to generate a random IV , since
it will be both unpredictable and have a very low chance of being non-unique. IVs do not have to be kept secret, so if generating
duplicate IVs is a concern, a list of already-used IVs can be kept and checked against.
NIST offers recommendations on generation of IVs for modes of which they have approved. These include options for when
random IVs are not practical. For CBC, CFB, and OFB, see [ REF-1175 ]; for GCM, see [ REF-1178 ].

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1204.html 3/3This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy , and predictability can vary widely . Within the developer and other
communities, "randomness" is used heavily . However , within cryptography , "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement.
There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will
attempt to define these terms and, if necessary , distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for dif ferent communities but
do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.
