CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe
Reflection')
Weakness ID: 470
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not suf ficiently prevent the input from
selecting improper classes or code.
 Extended Description
If the product uses external inputs to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, then an attacker could supply
values to select unexpected classes or methods. If this occurs, then the attacker could create control flow paths that were not
intended by the developer . These paths could bypass authentication or access control checks, or otherwise cause the product to
behave in an unexpected manner . This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that
appears on the product's classpath ( CWE-427 ) or add new entries to the product's classpath ( CWE-426 ). Under either of these
conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new , malicious behavior into the product.

The attacker might be able to execute code that is not directly accessible to the attacker . Alternately ,
the attacker could call unexpected code in the wrong place or the wrong time, possibly modifying
critical system state.

OtherTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Other
The attacker might be able to use reflection to call the wrong code, possibly with unexpected
arguments that violate the API ( CWE-227 ). This could cause the product to exit or hang.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/470.html 2/3By causing the wrong code to be invoked, the attacker might be able to trigger a runtime error that
leaks sensitive information in the error message, such as CWE-536 .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
A common reason that programmers use the reflection API is to implement their own command dispatcher . The following example
shows a command dispatcher that does not use reflection:
A programmer might refactor this code to use reflection as follows:
The refactoring initially appears to of fer a number of advantages. There are fewer lines of code, the if/else blocks have been entirely
eliminated, and it is now possible to add new command types without modifying the command dispatcher . However , the refactoring
allows an attacker to instantiate any object that implements the W orker interface. If the command dispatcher is still responsible for
access control, then whenever programmers create a new class that implements the W orker interface, they must remember to modify
the dispatcher's access control code. If they do not modify the access control code, then some W orker classes will not have any
access control.
One way to address this access control problem is to make the W orker object responsible for performing the access control check. An
example of the re-refactored code follows:
Although this is an improvement, it encourages a decentralized approach to access control, which makes it easier for programmers to
make access control mistakes. This code also highlights another security problem with using reflection to build a command
dispatcher . An attacker can invoke the default constructor for any kind of object. In fact, the attacker is not even constrained to objects
that implement the W orker interface; the default constructor for any object in the system can be invoked. If the object does not
implement the W orker interface, a ClassCastException will be thrown before the assignment to ao, but if the constructor performs
operations that work in the attacker's favor , the damage will already have been done. Although this scenario is relatively benign in
simple products, in larger products where complexity grows exponentially it is not unreasonable that an attacker could find a
constructor to leverage as part of an attack.

CVE-2018-1000613 Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key
CVE-2004-2331 Database system allows attackers to bypass sandbox restrictions by using the Reflection API.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Refactor your code to avoid using reflection.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Do not use user-controlled inputs to select and load classes or code.
Phase: Implementation
Apply strict input validation by using allowlists or indirect selection to ensure that the user is only selecting allowable classes or
code.(good code) Example Language: Java 
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Worker ao = null;
if (ctl.equals("Add")) {
ao = new AddCommand();
}
else if (ctl.equals("Modify")) {
ao = new ModifyCommand();
}
else {
throw new UnknownActionError();
}
ao.doAction(request);
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
ao.doAction(request);
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
ao.checkAccessControl(request);
ao.doAction(request);3/7/24, 3:01 PM CWE - CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reﬂection') (4.14)

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
