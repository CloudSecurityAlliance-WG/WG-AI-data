 Description
A trapdoor is a hidden piece of code that responds to a special input, allowing its user access to resources without passing through
the normal security enforcement mechanism.

Phase: Installation
Always verify the integrity of the software that is being installed.
Phase: T esting
Identify and closely inspect the conditions for entering privileged areas of the code, especially those related to authentication,
process invocation, and network communications.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Inter-application Flow Analysis
Binary / Bytecode simple extractor - strings, ELF readers, etc.
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies
Generated Code Inspection
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/510.html 2/2Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Automated Monitored Execution
Forced Path Execution
Debugger
Monitored V irtual Environment - run potentially malicious code in sandbox / wrapper / virtual machine, see if it does
anything suspicious
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source
Effectiveness: High
Automated Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Context-configured Source Code W eakness Analyzer
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Architecture or Design Review
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction
Effectiveness: High

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
