CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
Weakness ID: 799
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor , such as the number of incoming
requests.
 Extended Description
This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process
such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a
single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess
a password. Or , a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day .
 Alternate T erms
Insufficient anti-automation: The term "insuf ficient anti-automation" focuses primarly on non-human actors such as viruses or
bots, but the scope of this CWE entry is broader .
Brute force: Vulnerabilities that can be targeted using brute force attacks are often symptomatic of this
weakness.

Example 1
In the following code a username and password is read from a socket and an attempt is made to authenticate the username and
password. The code will continuously checked the socket for a username and password until it has been authenticated.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

}3/7/24, 3:10 PM CWE - CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/799.html 2/2This code does not place any restriction on the number of authentication attempts made. There should be a limit on the number of
authentication attempts made to prevent brute force attacks as in the following example code.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-1876 Mail server allows attackers to prevent other users from accessing mail by sending large number of
rapid requests.
