CWE-1390: W eak Authentication
Weakness ID: 1390
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not
sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.
 Extended Description
Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less ef fort than expected.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1390.html 2/2Example 1
In 2022, the OT :ICEF ALL study examined products by 10 dif ferent Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56
vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [ REF-1283 ]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed
adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed.
Since these products were often used in industries such as power , electrical, water , and others, there could even be safety
implications.
Multiple OT products used weak authentication.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-30034 Chain: W eb UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails
(CWE-777 ), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth ( CWE-1390 ).
CVE-2022-35248 Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, ef fectively
removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
CVE-2021-3116 Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators ( CWE-480 ) causing an
incorrect comparison ( CWE-697 ) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead
of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication ( CWE-1390 )
CVE-2022-29965 Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords
CVE-2022-29959 Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a "simple string transformation"
CVE-2020-8994 UAR T interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell
