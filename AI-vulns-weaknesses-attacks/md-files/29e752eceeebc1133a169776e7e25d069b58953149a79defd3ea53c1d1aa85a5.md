 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code shows a simple example of a double free vulnerability .
Double free vulnerabilities have two common (and sometimes overlapping) causes:
Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances
Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory
Although some double free vulnerabilities are not much more complicated than this example, most are spread out across hundreds of
lines of code or even dif ferent files. Programmers seem particularly susceptible to freeing global variables more than once.
Example 2
This code binds a server socket to port 21, allowing the server to listen for traf fic on that port.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/675.html 2/2This code may result in two servers binding a socket to same port, thus receiving each other's traf fic. This could be used by an
attacker to steal packets meant for another process, such as a secure FTP server .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2009-0935 Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
CVE-2019-13351 file descriptor double close can cause the wrong file to be associated with a file descriptor .
CVE-2004-1939 XSS protection mechanism attempts to remove "/" that could be used to close tags, but it can be
bypassed using double encoded slashes (%252F)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW
(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:
Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
 Notes
Relationship
This weakness is probably closely associated with other issues related to doubling, such as CWE-462 (duplicate key in alist) or
CWE-102 (Struts duplicate validation forms). It's usually a case of an API contract violation ( CWE-227 ).
