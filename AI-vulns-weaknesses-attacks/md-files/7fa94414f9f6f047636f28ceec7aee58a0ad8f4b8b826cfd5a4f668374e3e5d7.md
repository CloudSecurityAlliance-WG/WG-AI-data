Layer
Weakness ID: 1054
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides at a deeper layer than the adjacent layer , i.e., the invocation skips at
least one layer , and the invoked code is not part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer .
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or
time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
