View customized information:
 Description
The product is deployed to unauthorized actors with debugging code still enabled or active, which can create unintended entry points
or expose sensitive information.
 Extended Description
A common development practice is to add "back door" code specifically designed for debugging or testing purposes that is not
intended to be shipped or deployed with the product. These back door entry points create security risks because they are not
considered during design or testing and fall outside of the expected operating conditions of the product.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
ImplementationIn web-based applications, debug code is used to test and modify web application properties,
configuration information, and functions. If a debug application is left on a production server , this oversight
during the "software process" allows attackers access to debug functionality .

OtherTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Read Application Data; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity; Varies by
Context
The severity of the exposed debug application will depend on the particular instance. At the least, it
will give an attacker sensitive information about the settings and mechanics of web applications on
the server . At worst, as is often the case, the debug application will allow an attacker complete
control over the web application and server , as well as confidential information that either of these
access.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/489.html 2/3Debug code can be used to bypass authentication. For example, suppose an application has a login script that receives a username
and a password. Assume also that a third, optional, parameter , called "debug", is interpreted by the script as requesting a switch to
debug mode, and that when this parameter is given the username and password are not checked. In such a case, it is very simple to
bypass the authentication process if the special behavior of the application regarding the debug parameter is known. In a case where
the form is:
Then a conforming link will look like:
An attacker can change this to:
Which will grant the attacker access to the site, bypassing the authentication process.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Build and Compilation; Distribution
Remove debug code before deploying the application.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

In J2EE a main method may be a good indicator that debug code has been left in the application, although there may not be any
direct security impact.
