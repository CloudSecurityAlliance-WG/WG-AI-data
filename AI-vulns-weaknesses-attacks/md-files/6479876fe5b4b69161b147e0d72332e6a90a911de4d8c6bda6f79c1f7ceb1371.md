CWE-792: Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements
Weakness ID: 792
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not completely filter one or more instances of special elements
before sending it to a downstream component.
 Extended Description
Incomplete filtering of this nature involves either:
only filtering a single instance of a special element when more exist, or
not filtering all instances or all elements where multiple special elements exist.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code takes untrusted input and uses a regular expression to filter "../" from the input. It then appends this result to the
/home/user/ directory and attempts to read the file in the final resulting path.
Since the regular expression does not have the /g global match modifier , it only removes the first instance of "../" it comes across. So
an input value such as:
will have the first "../" stripped, resulting in:
This value is then concatenated with the /home/user/ directory:About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/792.html 2/2which causes the /etc/passwd file to be retrieved once the operating system has resolved the ../ sequences in the pathname. This
leads to relative path traversal ( CWE-23 ).

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
