 Description
The code does not suf ficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified
in unexpected ways.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/691.html 2/3However , the code does not check the value returned by pthread\_mutex\_lock() for errors. If pthread\_mutex\_lock() cannot acquire the
mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior .
In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately
handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.
Example 2
In this example, the programmer has indented the statements to call Do\_X() and Do\_Y(), as if the intention is that these functions are
only called when the condition is true. However , because there are no braces to signify the block, Do\_Y() will always be executed,
even if the condition is false.
This might not be what the programmer intended. When the condition is critical for security , such as in making a security decision or
detecting a critical error , this may produce a vulnerability .
Example 3
This function prints the contents of a specified file requested by a user .
This code first reads a specified file into memory , then prints the file if the user is authorized to see its contents. The read of the file
into memory may be resource intensive and is unnecessary if the user is not allowed to see the file anyway .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-9805 Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete ( CWE-696 ) resulting in a
read from uninitialized memory ( CWE-908 ), causing memory corruption.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar . However , classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there
can be gaps or organizational dif ficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.
Comments:
Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
