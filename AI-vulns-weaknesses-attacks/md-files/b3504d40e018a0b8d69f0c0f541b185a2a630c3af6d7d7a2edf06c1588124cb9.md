CWE-207: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy W ith Equivalent Products
Weakness ID: 207
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product operates in an environment in which its existence or specific identity should not be known, but it behaves dif ferently than
other products with equivalent functionality , in a way that is observable to an attacker .
 Extended Description
For many kinds of products, multiple products may be available that perform the same functionality , such as a web server , network
interface, or intrusion detection system. Attackers often perform "fingerprinting," which uses discrepancies in order to identify which
specific product is in use. Once the specific product has been identified, the attacks can be made more customized and ef ficient.
Often, an organization might intentionally allow the specific product to be identifiable. However , in some environments, the ability to
identify a distinct product is unacceptable, and it is expected that every product would behave in exactly the same way . In these more
restricted environments, a behavioral dif ference might pose an unacceptable risk if it makes it easier to identify the product's vendor ,
model, configuration, version, etc.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/207.html 2/2This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
