CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
Weakness ID: 405
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive
resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is
"asymmetric."
 Extended Description
This can lead to poor performance due to "amplification" of resource consumption, typically in a non-linear fashion. This situation is
worsened if the product allows malicious users or attackers to consume more resources than their access level permits.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/405.html 2/4Example 1
This code listens on a port for DNS requests and sends the result to the requesting address.
This code sends a DNS record to a requesting IP address. UDP allows the source IP address to be easily changed ('spoofed'), thus
allowing an attacker to redirect responses to a target, which may be then be overwhelmed by the network traf fic.
Example 2
This function prints the contents of a specified file requested by a user .
This code first reads a specified file into memory , then prints the file if the user is authorized to see its contents. The read of the file
into memory may be resource intensive and is unnecessary if the user is not allowed to see the file anyway .
Example 3
The DTD and the very brief XML below illustrate what is meant by an XML bomb. The ZERO entity contains one character , the letter
A. The choice of entity name ZERO is being used to indicate length equivalent to that exponent on two, that is, the length of ZERO is
2^0. Similarly , ONE refers to ZERO twice, therefore the XML parser will expand ONE to a length of 2, or 2^1. Ultimately , we reach
entity THIR TYTWO, which will expand to 2^32 characters in length, or 4 GB, probably consuming far more data than expected.
Example 4
This example attempts to check if an input string is a "sentence" [ REF-1164 ].
The regular expression has a vulnerable backtracking clause inside (\w+\s?)\*$ which can be triggered to cause a Denial of Service by
processing particular phrases.
To fix the backtracking problem, backtracking is removed with the ?= portion of the expression which changes it to a lookahead and
the \2 which prevents the backtracking. The modified example is:(bad code) Example Language: Python 
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_DGRAM)
sock.bind( (UDP\_IP,UDP\_PORT) )
while true:
data = sock.recvfrom(1024)
if not data:
break
(requestIP, nameToResolve) = parseUDPpacket(data)
record = resolveName(nameToResolve)
sendResponse(requestIP,record)
(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
function printFile($username,$filename){
//read file into string
$file = file\_get\_contents($filename);
if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
echo $file;
return true;
}
else{
echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
}
return false;
}
(attack code) Example Language: XML 
xml version="1.0"?

Example 5
An adversary can cause significant resource consumption on a server by filtering the cryptographic algorithms of fered by the client to
the ones that are the most resource-intensive on the server side. After discovering which cryptographic algorithms are supported by
the server , a malicious client can send the initial cryptographic handshake messages that contains only the resource-intensive
algorithms. For some cryptographic protocols, these messages can be completely prefabricated, as the resource-intensive part of the
handshake happens on the server-side first (such as TLS), rather than on the client side. In the case of cryptographic protocols where
the resource-intensive part should happen on the client-side first (such as SSH), a malicious client can send a forged/precalculated
computation result, which seems correct to the server , so the resource-intensive part of the handshake is going to happen on the
server side. A malicious client is required to send only the initial messages of a cryptographic handshake to initiate the resource-
consuming part of the cryptographic handshake. These messages are usually small, and generating them requires minimal
computational ef fort, enabling a denial-of-service attack. An additional risk is the fact that higher key size increases the ef fectiveness
of the attack. Cryptographic protocols where the clients have influence over the size of the used key (such as TLS 1.3 or SSH) are
most at risk, as the client can enforce the highest key size supported by the server .

CVE-2020-10735 Python has "quadratic complexity" issue when converting string to int with many digits in unexpected
bases
CVE-2020-5243 server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause
excessive backtracking.
CVE-2013-5211 composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source
addresses.
CVE-2002-20001 Diffie-Hellman (DHE) Key Agreement Protocol allows attackers to send arbitrary numbers that are not
public keys, which causes the server to perform expensive, unnecessary computation of modular
exponentiation.
CVE-2022-40735 The Dif fie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents, which are more
computationally expensive than using certain "short exponents" with particular properties.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
An application must make resources available to a client commensurate with the client's access level.
Phase: Architecture and Design
An application must, at all times, keep track of allocated resources and meter their usage appropriately .
Phase: System Configuration
Consider disabling resource-intensive algorithms on the server side, such as Dif fie-Hellman key exchange.
Effectiveness: High
Note: Business requirements may prevent disabling resource-intensive algorithms.
