CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without V alidation and Integrity Checking
Weakness ID: 565
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure
that the setting is valid for the associated user .
 Extended Description
Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser . Reliance on
cookies without detailed validation and integrity checking can allow attackers to bypass authentication, conduct injection attacks such
as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, or otherwise modify inputs in unexpected ways.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and DesignOMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design
phase.
Implementation
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
It is dangerous to use cookies to set a user's privileges. The cookie can be manipulated to escalate
an attacker's privileges to an administrative level.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code excerpt reads a value from a browser cookie to determine the role of the user .
It is easy for an attacker to modify the "role" value found in the locally stored cookie, allowing privilege escalation.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Avoid using cookie data for a security-related decision.
Phase: Implementation
Perform thorough input validation (i.e.: server side validation) on the cookie data if you're going to use it for a security related
decision.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Add integrity checks to detect tampering.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-
encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single
transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an
unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
This problem can be primary to many types of weaknesses in web applications. A developer may perform proper validation against
URL parameters while assuming that attackers cannot modify cookies. As a result, the program might skip basic input validation to
enable cross-site scripting, SQL injection, price tampering, and other attacks..
