ML Attack Implementations
Summary󰅂 󰅂 󰅂
Adversaries may search for existing open source
implementations of machine learning attacks. The research
community often publishes their code for reproducibility
and to further future research. Libraries intended for
research purposes, such as CleverHans, the Adversarial
Robustness Toolbox, and FoolBox, can be weaponized by
an adversary. Adversaries may also obtain and use tools
that were not originally designed for adversarial ML attacks
as part of their attack.ID: AML.T0016.000
