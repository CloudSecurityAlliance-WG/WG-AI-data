Sphere
Weakness ID: 527
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product stores a CVS, git, or other repository in a directory , archive, or other resource that is stored, transferred, or otherwise
made accessible to unauthorized actors.
 Extended Description
Version control repositories such as CVS or git store version-specific metadata and other details within subdirectories. If these
subdirectories are stored on a web server or added to an archive, then these could be used by an attacker . This information may
include usernames, filenames, path root, IP addresses, and detailed "dif f" data about how files have been changed - which could
reveal source code snippets that were never intended to be made public.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼
