CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
Weakness ID: 680
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less
memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buf fer overflow .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following image processing code allocates a table for images.
This code intends to allocate a table of size num\_imgs, however as num\_imgs grows large, the calculation determining the size of the
list will eventually overflow ( CWE-190 ). This will result in a very small list to be allocated instead. If the subsequent code operates on
the list as if it were num\_imgs long, it may result in many types of out-of-bounds problems ( CWE-119 ).
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-43537 Chain: in a web browser , an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer ( CWE-681 ) and
potentially leading to an integer overflow ( CWE-190 ). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap
memory corruption ( CWE-122 )
CVE-2017-1000121 chain: unchecked message size metadata allows integer overflow ( CWE-190 ) leading to buf fer
overflow ( CWE-119 ).

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.
Comments:
Mapping to each separate weakness in the chain would be more precise.
