 Notes
Maintenance
The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research
view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two dif ferent pillars, related to control of resources ( CWE-664 ) and protection
mechanism failures ( CWE-693 ).
Maintenance
This item needs more work. Possible sub-categories include: user in wrong group, and user with insecure profile or "configuration". It
also might be better expressed as a category than a weakness.
