Weakness ID: 1087
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A class contains a virtual method, but the method does not have an associated virtual destructor .
 Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably , e.g. due to undefined behavior . If the relevant code is reachable by an
attacker , then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
