CWE-477: Use of Obsolete Function
Weakness ID: 477
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code uses deprecated or obsolete functions, which suggests that the code has not been actively reviewed or maintained.
 Extended Description
As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to:
Advances in the language
Improved understanding of how operations should be performed ef fectively and securely
Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations
Functions that are removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some dif ferent and hopefully
improved way .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code uses the deprecated function getpw() to verify that a plaintext password matches a user's encrypted password. If
the password is valid, the function sets result to 1; otherwise it is set to 0.
Although the code often behaves correctly , using the getpw() function can be problematic from a security standpoint, because it can
overflow the buf fer passed to its second parameter . Because of this vulnerability , getpw() has been supplanted by getpwuid(), which
performs the same lookup as getpw() but returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure to mitigate the risk. Not all functions areAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/477.html 2/4deprecated or replaced because they pose a security risk. However , the presence of an obsolete function often indicates that the
surrounding code has been neglected and may be in a state of disrepair . Software security has not been a priority , or even a
consideration, for very long. If the program uses deprecated or obsolete functions, it raises the probability that there are security
problems lurking nearby .
Example 2
In the following code, the programmer assumes that the system always has a property named "cmd" defined. If an attacker can
control the program's environment so that "cmd" is not defined, the program throws a null pointer exception when it attempts to call
the "T rim()" method.
Example 3
The following code constructs a string object from an array of bytes and a value that specifies the top 8 bits of each 16-bit Unicode
character .
In this example, the constructor may not correctly convert bytes to characters depending upon which charset is used to encode the
string represented by nameBytes. Due to the evolution of the charsets used to encode strings, this constructor was deprecated and
replaced by a constructor that accepts as one of its parameters the name of the charset used to encode the bytes for conversion.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Refer to the documentation for the obsolete function in order to determine why it is deprecated or obsolete and to learn about
alternative ways to achieve the same functionality .
Phase: Requirements
Consider seriously the security implications of using an obsolete function. Consider using alternate functions.

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Binary / Bytecode Quality Analysis
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Bytecode W eakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis
Effectiveness: High
Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Debugger(bad code) Example Language: Java 
String cmd = null;
...
cmd = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("cmd");
cmd = cmd.Trim();
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
...
String name = new String(nameBytes, highByte);

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
