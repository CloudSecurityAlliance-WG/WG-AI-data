View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a storable data element that does not have all of the associated functions or methods that are necessary to support
comparison.
 Extended Description
For example, with Java, a class that is made persistent requires both hashCode() and equals() methods to be defined.
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably , due to incorrect or unexpected comparison results. If the relevant code is
reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability .
