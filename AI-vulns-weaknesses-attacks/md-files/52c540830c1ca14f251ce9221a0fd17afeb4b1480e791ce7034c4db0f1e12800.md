CWE-544: Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism
Weakness ID: 544
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not use a standardized method for handling errors throughout the code, which might introduce inconsistent error
handling and resultant weaknesses.
 Extended Description
If the product handles error messages individually , on a one-by-one basis, this is likely to result in inconsistent error handling. The
causes of errors may be lost. Also, detailed information about the causes of an error may be unintentionally returned to the user .

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and DesignOMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design
phase.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation; Unexpected State; Varies by Context
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
define a strategy for handling errors of dif ferent severities, such as fatal errors versus basic log events. Use or create built-in
language features, or an external package, that provides an easy-to-use API and define coding standards for the detection and
handling of errors.

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
