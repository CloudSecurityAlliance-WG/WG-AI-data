CWE-684: Incorrect Provision of Specified Functionality
Weakness ID: 684
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The code does not function according to its published specifications, potentially leading to incorrect usage.
 Extended Description
When providing functionality to an external party , it is important that the product behaves in accordance with the details specified.
When requirements of nuances are not documented, the functionality may produce unintended behaviors for the caller , possibly
leading to an exploitable state.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following snippet from a doPost() servlet method, the server returns "200 OK" (default) even if an error occurs.
Example 2
In the following example, an HTTP 404 status code is returned in the event of an IOException encountered in a Java servlet. A 404
code is typically meant to indicate a non-existent resource and would be somewhat misleading in this case.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-1446 Error checking routine in PKCS#11 library returns "OK" status even when invalid signature is detected,
allowing spoofed messages.
CVE-2001-1559 Chain: System call returns wrong value ( CWE-393 ), leading to a resultant NULL dereference ( CWE-
476).
CVE-2003-0187 Program uses large timeouts on unconfirmed connections resulting from inconsistency in linked lists
implementations.
CVE-1999-1446 UI inconsistency; visited URLs list not cleared when "Clear History" option is selected.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that your code strictly conforms to specifications.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
