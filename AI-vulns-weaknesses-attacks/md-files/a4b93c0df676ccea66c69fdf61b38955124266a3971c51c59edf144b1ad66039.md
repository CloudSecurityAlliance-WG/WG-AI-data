CWE-773: Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle
Weakness ID: 773
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly maintain references to a file descriptor or handle, which prevents that file descriptor/handle from being
reclaimed.
 Extended Description
This can cause the product to consume all available file descriptors or handles, which can prevent other processes from performing
critical file processing operations.

Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)
An attacker that can influence the allocation of resources that are not properly maintained could deplete
the available resource pool and prevent all other processes from accessing the same type of resource.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Operation; Architecture and Design
Strategy: Resource Limitation
Use resource-limiting settings provided by the operating system or environment. For example, when managing system
resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many
resources are available. However , these functions are not available on all operating systems.
When the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (see CWE-770 ), then limit the allocation of
further resources to privileged users; alternately , begin releasing resources for less-privileged users. While this mitigation may
protect the system from attack, it will not necessarily stop attackers from adversely impacting other users.
Ensure that the application performs the appropriate error checks and error handling in case resources become unavailable
(CWE-703 ).

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/773.html 2/2This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
