CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs
Weakness ID: 648
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not conform to the API requirements for a function call that requires extra privileges. This could allow attackers to
gain privileges by causing the function to be called incorrectly .
 Extended Description
When a product contains certain functions that perform operations requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged
API must be careful to:
ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity of arguments
account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the API
call the API from a safe context
If the caller of the API does not follow these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their privilege,
hijack the process, or steal sensitive data.
For instance, it is important to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the caller or if the privileged
function might make certain assumptions about the data, context or state information passed to it by the caller . It is important to
always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.

3/7/24, 3:06 PM CWE - CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/648.html 2/2Reference Description
CVE-2003-0645 A Unix utility that displays online help files, if installed setuid, could allow a local attacker to gain
privileges when a particular file-opening function is called.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Before calling privileged APIs, always ensure that the assumptions made by the privileged code hold true prior to making the
call.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Know architecture and implementation weaknesses of the privileged APIs and make sure to account for these weaknesses
before calling the privileged APIs to ensure that they can be called safely .
Phase: Implementation
If privileged APIs make certain assumptions about data, context or state validity that are passed by the caller , the calling code
must ensure that these assumptions have been validated prior to making the call.
Phase: Implementation
If privileged APIs do not shed their privilege prior to returning to the calling code, then calling code needs to shed these
privileges immediately and safely right after the call to the privileged APIs. In particular , the calling code needs to ensure that a
privileged thread of execution will never be returned to the user or made available to user-controlled processes.
Phase: Implementation
Only call privileged APIs from safe, consistent and expected state.
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that a failure or an error will not leave a system in a state where privileges are not properly shed and privilege escalation
is possible (i.e. fail securely with regards to handling of privileges).

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
