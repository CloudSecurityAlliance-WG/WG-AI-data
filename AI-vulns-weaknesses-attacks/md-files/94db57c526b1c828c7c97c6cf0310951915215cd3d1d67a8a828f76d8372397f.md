CWE-561: Dead Code
Weakness ID: 561
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains dead code, which can never be executed.
 Extended Description
Dead code is code that can never be executed in a running program. The surrounding code makes it impossible for a section of code
to ever be executed.

Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation
Dead code that results from code that can never be executed is an indication of problems with the source
code that needs to be fixed and is an indication of poor quality .
OtherTechnical Impact: Reduce Maintainability
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The condition for the second if statement is impossible to satisfy . It requires that the variables be non-null. However , on the only path
where s can be assigned a non-null value, there is a return statement.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/561.html 2/4In the following class, two private methods call each other , but since neither one is ever invoked from anywhere else, they are both
dead code.
(In this case it is a good thing that the methods are dead: invoking either one would cause an infinite loop.)
Example 3
The field named glue is not used in the following class. The author of the class has accidentally put quotes around the field name,
transforming it into a string constant.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2014-1266 chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-
Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561
(Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate V alidation) -> CWE-393 (Return of W rong Status
Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Remove dead code before deploying the application.
Phase: T esting
Use a static analysis tool to spot dead code.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Architecture or Design Review
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)
Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Attack Modeling
Effectiveness: High
Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Binary / Bytecode Quality Analysis
Compare binary / bytecode to application permission manifest(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public class DoubleDead {
private void doTweedledee() {
doTweedledumb();
}
private void doTweedledumb() {
doTweedledee();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("running DoubleDead");
}
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public class Dead {
String glue;
public String getGlue() {
return "glue";
}

Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Automated Monitored Execution
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Automated Static Analysis
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Permission Manifest Analysis
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Automated Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Source Code Quality Analyzer
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Warning Flags
Source code W eakness Analyzer
Context-configured Source Code W eakness Analyzer
Effectiveness: High
Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Web Application Scanner
Web Services Scanner
Database Scanners
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source
Effectiveness: High

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
3/7/24, 3:03 PM CWE - CWE-561: Dead Code (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/561.html 4/4This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
