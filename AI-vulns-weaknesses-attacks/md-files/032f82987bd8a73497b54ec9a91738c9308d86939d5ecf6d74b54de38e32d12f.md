Weakness ID: 1164
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains code that is not essential for execution, i.e. makes no state changes and has no side ef fects that alter data or
control flow , such that removal of the code would have no impact to functionality or correctness.
 Extended Description
Irrelevant code could include dead code, initialization that is not used, empty blocks, code that could be entirely removed due to
optimization, etc.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The condition for the second if statement is impossible to satisfy . It requires that the variables be non-null. However , on the only path
where s can be assigned a non-null value, there is a return statement.
Example 2
The following code excerpt assigns to the variable r and then overwrites the value without using it.
