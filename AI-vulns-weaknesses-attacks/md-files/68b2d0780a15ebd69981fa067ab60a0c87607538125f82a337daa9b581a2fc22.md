CWE-547: Use of Hard-coded, Security-relevant Constants
Weakness ID: 547
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses hard-coded constants instead of symbolic names for security-critical values, which increases the likelihood of
mistakes during code maintenance or security policy change.
 Extended Description
If the developer does not find all occurrences of the hard-coded constants, an incorrect policy decision may be made if one of the
constants is not changed. Making changes to these values will require code changes that may be dif ficult or impossible once the
system is released to the field. In addition, these hard-coded values may become available to attackers if the code is ever disclosed.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Varies by Context; Quality Degradation
The existence of hardcoded constants could cause unexpected behavior and the introduction of
weaknesses during code maintenance or when making changes to the code if all occurrences are not
modified. The use of hardcoded constants is an indication of poor quality .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The usage of symbolic names instead of hard-coded constants is preferred.
The following is an example of using a hard-coded constant instead of a symbolic name.
If the buf fer value needs to be changed, then it has to be altered in more than one place. If the developer forgets or does not find all
occurrences, in this example it could lead to a buf fer overflow .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/547.html 2/2In this example the developer will only need to change one value and all references to the buf fer size are updated, as a symbolic
name is used instead of a hard-coded constant.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Avoid using hard-coded constants. Configuration files of fer a more flexible solution.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
