CWE-616: Incomplete Identification of Uploaded File V ariables (PHP)
Weakness ID: 616
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The PHP application uses an old method for processing uploaded files by referencing the four global variables that are set for each
file (e.g. $varname, $varname\_size, $varname\_name, $varname\_type). These variables could be overwritten by attackers, causing
the application to process unauthorized files.
 Extended Description
These global variables could be overwritten by POST requests, cookies, or other methods of populating or overwriting these
variables. This could be used to read or process arbitrary files by providing values such as "/etc/passwd".

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
As of 2006, the "four globals" method is probably in sharp decline, but older PHP applications could have this issue.
In the "four globals" method, PHP sets the following 4 global variables (where "varname" is application-dependent):
Example 2
"The global $\_FILES exists as of PHP 4.1.0 (Use $HTTP\_POST\_FILES instead if using an earlier version). These arrays will contain
all the uploaded file information."
\*\* note: 'userfile' is the field name from the web form; this can vary .

(bad code) Example Language: PHP

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/616.html 2/2CVE-2002-1460 Forum does not properly verify whether a file was uploaded or if the associated variables were set by
POST , allowing remote attackers to read arbitrary files.
CVE-2002-1759 Product doesn't check if the variables for an upload were set by uploading the file, or other methods
such as $\_POST .
CVE-2002-1710 Product does not distinguish uploaded file from other files.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use PHP 4 or later .
Phase: Architecture and Design
If you must support older PHP versions, write your own version of is\_uploaded\_file() and run it against
$HTTP\_POST\_FILES['userfile']))
Phase: Implementation
For later PHP versions, reference uploaded files using the $HTTP\_POST\_FILES or $\_FILES variables, and use
is\_uploaded\_file() or move\_uploaded\_file() to ensure that you are dealing with an uploaded file.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
