 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

3/7/24, 3:03 PM CWE - CWE-560: Use of umask() with chmod-style Argument (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/560.html 2/2Some umask() manual pages begin with the false statement: "umask sets the umask to mask & 0777" Although this behavior would
better align with the usage of chmod(), where the user provided argument specifies the bits to enable on the specified file, the
behavior of umask() is in fact opposite: umask() sets the umask to ~mask & 0777. The documentation goes on to describe the
correct usage of umask(): "The umask is used by open() to set initial file permissions on a newly-created file. Specifically ,
permissions in the umask are turned of f from the mode argument to open(2) (so, for example, the common umask default value of
022 results in new files being created with permissions 0666 & ~022 = 0644 = rw-r--r-- in the usual case where the mode is specified
as 0666)."
