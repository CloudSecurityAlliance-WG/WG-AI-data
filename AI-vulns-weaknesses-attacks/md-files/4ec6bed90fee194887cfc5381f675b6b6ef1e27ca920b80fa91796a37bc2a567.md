CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision
Weakness ID: 654
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A protection mechanism relies exclusively , or to a large extent, on the evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object
or entity in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or functionality .
 Alternate T erms
Separation of Privilege: Some people and publications use the term "Separation of Privilege" to describe this weakness, but
this term has dual meanings in current usage. While this entry is closely associated with the original
definition of "Separation of Privilege" by Saltzer and Schroeder , others use the same term to describe
poor compartmentalization ( CWE-653 ). Because there are multiple interpretations, use of the
"Separation of Privilege" term is discouraged.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
If the single factor is compromised (e.g. by theft or spoofing), then the integrity of the entire
security mechanism can be violated with respect to the user that is identified by that factor .
Non-RepudiationTechnical Impact: Hide Activities
It can become dif ficult or impossible for the product to be able to distinguish between legitimate
activities by the entity who provided the factor , versus illegitimate activities by an attacker .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Password-only authentication is perhaps the most well-known example of use of a single factor . Anybody who knows a user's
password can impersonate that user .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/654.html 2/3When authenticating, use multiple factors, such as "something you know" (such as a password) and "something you have" (such as a
hardware-based one-time password generator , or a biometric device).
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-35248 Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, ef fectively
removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use multiple simultaneous checks before granting access to critical operations or granting critical privileges. A weaker but helpful
mitigation is to use several successive checks (multiple layers of security).
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use redundant access rules on dif ferent choke points (e.g., firewalls).

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
This entry is closely associated with the term "Separation of Privilege." This term is used in several dif ferent ways in the industry , but
they generally combine two closely related principles: compartmentalization ( CWE-653 ) and using only one factor in a security
decision (this entry). Proper compartmentalization implicitly introduces multiple factors into a security decision, but there can be
cases in which multiple factors are required for authentication or other mechanisms that do not involve compartmentalization, such
as performing all required checks on a submitted certificate. It is likely that CWE-653 and CWE-654 will provoke further discussion.
