Weakness ID: 15
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
One or more system settings or configuration elements can be externally controlled by a user .
 Extended Description
Allowing external control of system settings can disrupt service or cause an application to behave in unexpected, and potentially
malicious ways.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
ImplementationSetting manipulation vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can control values that govern the behavior of the
system, manage specific resources, or in some way af fect the functionality of the application.
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following C code accepts a number as one of its command line parameters and sets it as the host ID of the current machine.
Although a process must be privileged to successfully invoke sethostid(), unprivileged users may be able to invoke the program. The
code in this example allows user input to directly control the value of a system setting. If an attacker provides a malicious value for
host ID, the attacker can misidentify the af fected machine on the network or cause other unintended behavior .
Example 2
The following Java code snippet reads a string from an HttpServletRequest and sets it as the active catalog for a database

the database.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive
data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.
Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and
reinforces privilege separation functionality . Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the
appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
Phases: Implementation; Architecture and Design
Because setting manipulation covers a diverse set of functions, any attempt at illustrating it will inevitably be incomplete. Rather
than searching for a tight-knit relationship between the functions addressed in the setting manipulation category , take a step
back and consider the sorts of system values that an attacker should not be allowed to control.
Phases: Implementation; Architecture and Design
In general, do not allow user-provided or otherwise untrusted data to control sensitive values. The leverage that an attacker
gains by controlling these values is not always immediately obvious, but do not underestimate the creativity of the attacker .
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
