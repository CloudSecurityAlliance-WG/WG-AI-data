CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control
Weakness ID: 1263
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not suf ficiently protect against an unauthorized actor
with physical access to these areas.
 Extended Description
Sections of a product intended to have restricted access may be inadvertently or intentionally rendered accessible when the
implemented physical protections are insuf ficient. The specific requirements around how robust the design of the physical protection
mechanism needs to be depends on the type of product being protected. Selecting the correct physical protection mechanism and
properly enforcing it through implementation and manufacturing are critical to the overall physical security of the product.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and DesignThis weakness can arise if design decisions are made that do not align with the intended physical
protection of the product
ManufacturingWhile the architecture and design phase of the product may have accurately met the intended
robustness for product physical protections, this phase may introduce the weakness through errors in
physically manufacturing the product.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Specific protection requirements depend strongly on contextual factors including the level of acceptable risk associated with
compromise to the product's protection mechanism. Designers could incorporate anti-tampering measures that protect against
or detect when the product has been tampered with.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1263.html 2/2Phase: T esting
The testing phase of the lifecycle should establish a method for determining whether the protection mechanism is suf ficient to
prevent unauthorized access.
Phase: Manufacturing
Ensure that all protection mechanisms are fully activated at the time of manufacturing and distribution.
