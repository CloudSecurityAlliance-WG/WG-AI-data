View customized information:
 Description
The product's behaviors indicate important dif ferences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its
internal state or decision process, or (2) dif ferences from other products with equivalent functionality .
 Extended Description
Ideally , a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use
knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by
attackers to form a side channel.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/205.html 2/2Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
