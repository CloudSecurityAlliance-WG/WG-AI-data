CWE-1089: Large Data T able with Excessive Number of Indices
Weakness ID: 1089
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a large data table that contains an excessively large number of indices.
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this performance problem
might introduce a vulnerability .
While the interpretation of "large data table" and "excessively large number of indices" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ
recommends a default threshold of 1000000 rows for a "large" table and a default threshold of 3 indices.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
