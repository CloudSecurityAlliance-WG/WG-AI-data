CWE-551: Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and
Canonicalization
Weakness ID: 551
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
If a web server does not fully parse requested URLs before it examines them for authorization, it may be possible for an attacker to
bypass authorization protection.
 Extended Description
For instance, the character strings /./ and / both mean current directory . If /SomeDirectory is a protected directory and an attacker
requests /./SomeDirectory , the attacker may be able to gain access to the resource if /./ is not converted to / before the authorization
check is performed.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
URL Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated and
processed for authorization. Make sure that your application does not decode the same input twice. Such errors could be used
to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/551.html 2/2This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
