 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code attempts to validate a given input path by checking it against an allowlist and then return the canonical path. In this
specific case, the path is considered valid if it starts with the string "/safe\_dir/".
The problem with the above code is that the validation step occurs before canonicalization occurs. An attacker could provide an input
path of "/safe\_dir/../" that would pass the validation step. However , the canonicalization process sees the double dot as a traversal to
the parent directory and hence when canonicized the path would become just "/".
To avoid this problem, validation should occur after canonicalization takes place. In this case canonicalization occurs during the
initialization of the File object. The code below fixes the issue.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/696.html 2/3Example 2
This function prints the contents of a specified file requested by a user .
This code first reads a specified file into memory , then prints the file if the user is authorized to see its contents. The read of the file
into memory may be resource intensive and is unnecessary if the user is not allowed to see the file anyway .
Example 3
Assume that the module foo\_bar implements a protected register . The register content is the asset. Only transactions made by user id
(indicated by signal usr\_id) 0x4 are allowed to modify the register contents. The signal grant\_access is used to provide access.
This code uses V erilog blocking assignments for data\_out and grant\_access. Therefore, these assignments happen sequentially (i.e.,
data\_out is updated to new value first, and grant\_access is updated the next cycle) and not in parallel. Therefore, the asset data\_out
is allowed to be modified even before the access control check is complete and grant\_access signal is set. Since grant\_access does
not have a reset value, it will be meta-stable and will randomly go to either 0 or 1.
Flipping the order of the assignment of data\_out and grant\_access should solve the problem. The correct snippet of code is shown
below .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-9805 Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete ( CWE-696 ) resulting in a
read from uninitialized memory ( CWE-908 ), causing memory corruption.
CVE-2007-5191 file-system management programs call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not
check the return values, allowing attackers to gain unintended privileges
CVE-2007-1588 C++ web server program calls Process::setuid before calling Process::setgid, preventing it from
dropping privileges, potentially allowing CGI programs to be called with higher privileges than intended
CVE-2022-37734 Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough ( CWE-
696), allowing excessive CPU consumption ( CWE-1176 )}
(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
function printFile($username,$filename){
//read file into string
$file = file\_get\_contents($filename);
if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
echo $file;
return true;
}
else{
echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
}
return false;
