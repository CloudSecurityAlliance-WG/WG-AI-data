View customized information:
 Description
The product declares a critical variable, field, or member to be public when intended security policy requires it to be private.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-consuming
to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Making a critical variable public allows anyone with access to the object in which the variable is
contained to alter or read the value.
OtherTechnical Impact: Reduce Maintainability
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example declares a critical variable public, making it accessible to anyone with access to the object in which it is
contained.
Instead, the critical data should be declared private.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/766.html 2/3Even though this example declares the password to be private, there are other possible issues with this implementation, such as the
possibility of recovering the password from process memory ( CWE-257 ).
Example 2
The following example shows a basic user account class that includes member variables for the username and password as well as a
public constructor for the class and a public method to authorize access to the user account.
However , the member variables username and password are declared public and therefore will allow access and changes to the
member variables to anyone with access to the object. These member variables should be declared private as shown below to
prevent unauthorized access and changes.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2010-3860 variables declared public allow remote read of system properties such as user name and home
directory .
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Data should be private, static, and final whenever possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early ,
preventing access, and preventing tampering.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description(bad code) Example Language: C++ 
#define MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH 15
#define MAX\_USERNAME\_LENGTH 15
class UserAccount
{
public:
UserAccount(char \*username, char \*password)
{
if ((strlen(username) > MAX\_USERNAME\_LENGTH) ||
(strlen(password) > MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH)) {
ExitError("Invalid username or password");
}
strcpy(this->username, username);
strcpy(this->password, password);
}
int authorizeAccess(char \*username, char \*password)
{
if ((strlen(username) > MAX\_USERNAME\_LENGTH) ||
(strlen(password) > MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH)) {
ExitError("Invalid username or password");
}
// if the username and password in the input parameters are equal to
// the username and password of this account class then authorize access
if (strcmp(this->username, username) ||
strcmp(this->password, password))
return 0;
// otherwise do not authorize access
else
return 1;
}
char username[MAX\_USERNAME\_LENGTH+1];
char password[MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH+1];
};
(good code) Example Language: C++ 
class UserAccount
{
public:
...
private:
char username[MAX\_USERNAME\_LENGTH+1];
char password[MAX\_PASSWORD\_LENGTH+1];

Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
