Weakness ID: 550
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
Certain conditions, such as network failure, will cause a server error message to be displayed.
 Extended Description
While error messages in and of themselves are not dangerous, per se, it is what an attacker can glean from them that might cause
eventual problems.
 Relationships

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; System Configuration
Recommendations include designing and adding consistent error handling mechanisms which are capable of handling any user
input to your web application, providing meaningful detail to end-users, and preventing error messages that might provide
information useful to an attacker from being displayed.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
