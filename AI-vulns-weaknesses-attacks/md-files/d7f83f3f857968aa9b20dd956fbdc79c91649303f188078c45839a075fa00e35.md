CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
Weakness ID: 201
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code transmits data to another actor , but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that
actor .
 Extended Description
Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful
in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Requirements
Specify which data in the software should be regarded as sensitive. Consider which types of users should have access to which
types of data.
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that any possibly sensitive data specified in the requirements is verified with designers to ensure that it is either a
calculated risk or mitigated elsewhere. Any information that is not necessary to the functionality should be removed in order to
lower both the overhead and the possibility of security sensitive data being sent.
Phase: System Configuration
Setup default error messages so that unexpected errors do not disclose sensitive information.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive
data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.
Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and
reinforces privilege separation functionality . Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the
appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
