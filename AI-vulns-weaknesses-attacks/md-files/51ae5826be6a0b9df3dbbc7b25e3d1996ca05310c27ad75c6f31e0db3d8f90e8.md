View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of multiple trailing slash ('/multiple/trailing/slash//') without appropriate validation, which can
lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

Reference Description
CVE-2002-1078 Directory listings in web server using multiple trailing slash
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/52.html 2/2Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
