CWE-587: Assignment of a Fixed Address to a Pointer
Weakness ID: 587
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product sets a pointer to a specific address other than NULL or 0.
 Extended Description
Using a fixed address is not portable, because that address will probably not be valid in all environments or platforms.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Integrity
Confidentiality
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
If one executes code at a known location, an attacker might be able to inject code there beforehand.
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Reduce Maintainability; Reduce Reliability
If the code is ported to another platform or environment, the pointer is likely to be invalid and cause a
crash.
Confidentiality
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Read Memory; Modify Memory
The data at a known pointer location can be easily read or influenced by an attacker .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This code assumes a particular function will always be found at a particular address. It assigns a pointer to that address and calls the
function.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/587.html 2/2The same function may not always be found at the same memory address. This could lead to a crash, or an attacker may alter the
memory at the expected address, leading to arbitrary code execution.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Never set a pointer to a fixed address.

Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
