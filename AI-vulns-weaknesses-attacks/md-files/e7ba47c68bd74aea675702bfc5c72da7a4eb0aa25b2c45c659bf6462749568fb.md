CWE-1419: Incorrect Initialization of Resource
Weakness ID: 1419
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product attempts to initialize a resource but does not correctly do so, which might leave the resource in an unexpected, incorrect,
or insecure state when it is accessed.
 Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values. Examples include
a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not, or a register or fuse value that determines the security state
of the product.
For software, this weakness can frequently occur when implicit initialization is used, meaning the resource is not explicitly set to a
specific value. For example, in C, memory is not necessarily cleared when it is allocated on the stack, and many scripting languages
use a default empty , null value, or zero value when a variable is not explicitly initialized.
For hardware, this weakness frequently appears with reset values and fuses. After a product reset, hardware may initialize registers
incorrectly . During dif ferent phases of a product lifecycle, fuses may be set to incorrect values. Even if fuses are set to correct values,
the lines to the fuse could be broken or there might be hardware on the fuse line that alters the fuse value to be incorrect.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Consider example design module system verilog code shown below . The register\_example module is an example parameterized
module that defines two parameters, REGISTER\_WIDTH and REGISTER\_DEF AULT. Register\_example module defines a
Secure\_mode setting, which when set makes the register content read-only and not modifiable by software writes. register\_top
module instantiates two registers, Insecure\_Device\_ID\_1 and Insecure\_Device\_ID\_2. Generally , registers containing device identifier
values are required to be read only to prevent any possibility of software modifying these values.
These example instantiations show how , in a hardware design, it would be possible to instantiate the register module with insecure
defaults and parameters.
In the example design, both registers will be software writable since Secure\_mode is defined as zero.(bad code) Example Language: Verilog 
// Parameterized Register module example
// Secure\_mode : REGISTER\_DEFAULT[0] : When set to 1 register is read only and not writable//
module register\_example
#(
parameter REGISTER\_WIDTH = 8, // Parameter defines width of register, default 8 bits
parameter [REGISTER\_WIDTH-1:0] REGISTER\_DEFAULT = 2\*\*REGISTER\_WIDTH -2 // Default value of register computed from Width.
Sets all bits to 1s except bit 0 (Secure \_mode)
)
(
input [REGISTER\_WIDTH-1:0] Data\_in,
input Clk,
input resetn,
input write,
output reg [REGISTER\_WIDTH-1:0] Data\_out
);
reg Secure\_mode;
always @(posedge Clk or negedge resetn)
if (~resetn)
begin
Data\_out <= REGISTER\_DEFAULT; // Register content set to Default at reset
Secure\_mode <= REGISTER\_DEFAULT[0]; // Register Secure\_mode set at reset
end
else if (write & ~Secure\_mode)
begin
Data\_out <= Data\_in;
end
endmodule
module register\_top

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1419.html 3/4Example 2
This code attempts to login a user using credentials from a POST request:
Because the $authorized variable is never initialized, PHP will automatically set $authorized to any value included in the POST
request if register\_globals is enabled. An attacker can send a POST request with an unexpected third value 'authorized' set to 'true'
and gain authorized status without supplying valid credentials.
Here is a fixed version:
This code avoids the issue by initializing the $authorized variable to false and explicitly retrieving the login credentials from the
$\_POST variable. Regardless, register\_globals should never be enabled and is disabled by default in current versions of PHP .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2020-27211 Chain: microcontroller system-on-chip uses a register value stored in flash to set product protection
state on the memory bus and does not contain protection against fault injection ( CWE-1319 ) which
leads to an incorrect initialization of the memory bus ( CWE-1419 ) causing the product to be in an
unprotected state.
CVE-2023-25815 chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a
hard-coded path ( CWE-1419 ) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path
element ( CWE-427 ) that enables spoofing of messages.
CVE-2022-43468 WordPress module sets internal variables based on external inputs, allowing false reporting of the
number of views
CVE-2022-36349 insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS
CVE-2015-7763 distributed filesystem only initializes part of the variable-length padding for a packet, allowing attackers
to read sensitive information from previously-sent packets in the same memory location
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Choose the safest-possible initialization for security-related resources.
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that each resource (whether variable, memory buf fer, register , etc.) is fully initialized.
Phase: Implementation
Pay close attention to complex conditionals or reset sources that af fect initialization, since some paths might not perform the
initialization.
Phase: Architecture and Design(good code) Example Language: Verilog 
register\_example #(
.REGISTER\_WIDTH (32),
.REGISTER\_DEFAULT (1225) // Correct default value set, to enable Secure\_mode
) Secure\_Device\_ID\_example (
.Data\_in (Data\_in),
.Data\_out (Secure\_reg),
.Clk (Clk),
.resetn (resetn),
.write (write)
);
(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login\_user($user,$pass)) {
$authorized = true;
}
...
if ($authorized) {
generatePage();
}
(good code) Example Language: PHP 
$user = $\_POST['user'];
$pass = $\_POST['pass'];
$authorized = false;
if (login\_user($user,$pass)) {
$authorized = true;
}

security implications.
