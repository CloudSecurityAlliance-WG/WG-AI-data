CWE-600: Uncaught Exception in Servlet
Weakness ID: 600
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The Servlet does not catch all exceptions, which may reveal sensitive debugging information.
 Extended Description
When a Servlet throws an exception, the default error response the Servlet container sends back to the user typically includes
debugging information. This information is of great value to an attacker . For example, a stack trace might show the attacker a
malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container . This information enables
the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example attempts to resolve a hostname.
A DNS lookup failure will cause the Servlet to throw an exception.
 Potential Mitigations

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
The "Missing Catch Block" concept is probably broader than just Servlets, but the broader concept is not suf ficiently covered in
CWE.
