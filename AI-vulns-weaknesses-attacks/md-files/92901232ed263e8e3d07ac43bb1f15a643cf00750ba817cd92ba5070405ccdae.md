CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
Weakness ID: 471
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker .
 Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is.
Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and
reverse DNS lookups.

Common data types that are attacked are environment variables, web application parameters, and HTTP
headers.
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Unexpected State
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the code excerpt below , an array returned by a Java method is modified despite the fact that arrays are mutable.

 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation; Implementation
When the data is stored or transmitted through untrusted sources that could modify the data, implement integrity checks to
detect unauthorized modification, or store/transmit the data in a trusted location that is free from external influence.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to
internal program constructs, such as PHP's register\_globals and similar features. However , MAID issues can also be resultant from
weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory , but a buf fer
overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.
Theoretical
There are many examples where the MUT ABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability .
