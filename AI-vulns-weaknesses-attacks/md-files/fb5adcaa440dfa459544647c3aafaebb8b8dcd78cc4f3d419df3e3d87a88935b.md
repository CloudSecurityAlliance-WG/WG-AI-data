 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example the updateInventory() method used within an e-business product ordering/inventory application will
check if the input product number is in the store or in the warehouse. If the product is found, the method will update the store or
warehouse database as well as the aggregate product database. If the product is not found, the method intends to do some special
processing without updating any database.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public void updateInventory(String productNumber) {
boolean isProductAvailable = false;
boolean isDelayed = false;
if (productInStore(productNumber)) {
isProductAvailable = true;
updateInStoreDatabase(productNumber);
}
else if (productInWarehouse(productNumber)) {

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/571.html 2/2However , the method never sets the isDelayed variable and instead will always update the isProductA vailable variable to true. The
result is that the predicate testing the isProductA vailable boolean will always evaluate to true and therefore always update the product
database. Further , since the isDelayed variable is initialized to false and never changed, the expression always evaluates to false and
the customer will never be warned of a delay on their product.

Phase: T esting
Use Static Analysis tools to spot such conditions.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
