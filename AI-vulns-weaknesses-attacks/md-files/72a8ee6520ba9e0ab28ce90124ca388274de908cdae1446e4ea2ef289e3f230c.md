CWE-1069: Empty Exception Block
Weakness ID: 1069
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
An invokable code block contains an exception handling block that does not contain any code, i.e. is empty .
 Extended Description
When an exception handling block (such as a Catch and Finally block) is used, but that block is empty , this can prevent the product
from running reliably . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example, the code catches an ArithmeticException.
Since the exception block is empty , no action is taken.
In the code below the exception has been logged and the bad execution has been handled in the desired way allowing the program to
continue in an expected way .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
For every exception block add code that handles the specific exception in the way intended by the application.
