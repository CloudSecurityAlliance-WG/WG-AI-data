CWE-1038: Insecure Automated Optimizations
Weakness ID: 1038
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a mechanism that automatically optimizes code, e.g. to improve a characteristic such as performance, but the
optimizations can have an unintended side ef fect that might violate an intended security assumption.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 758 Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior
ChildOf 435 Improper Interaction Between Multiple Correctly-Behaving Entities
ParentOf 733 Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code
ParentOf 1037 Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design Optimizations built into the design of a product can have unintended consequences during execution.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Alter Execution Logic
The optimizations alter the order of execution resulting in side ef fects that were not intended by the original
developer .
 Likelihood Of Exploit
Low
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2017-5715 Intel, ARM, and AMD processor optimizations related to speculative execution and branch prediction
cause access control checks to be bypassed when placing data into the cache. Often known as
"Spectre".
CVE-2008-1685 C compiler optimization, as allowed by specifications, removes code that is used to perform checks to
detect integer overflows.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
This weakness does not depend on other weaknesses and is the result of choices made during optimization.
