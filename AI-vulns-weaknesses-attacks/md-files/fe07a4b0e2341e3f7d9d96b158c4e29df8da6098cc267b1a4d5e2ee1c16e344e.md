View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of multiple internal slash ('/multiple//internal/slash/') without appropriate validation, which
can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary
files.

Reference Description
CVE-2002-1483 Read files with full pathname using multiple internal slash.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/51.html 2/2Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
