CWE-1294: Insecure Security Identifier Mechanism
Weakness ID: 1294
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The System-on-Chip (SoC) implements a Security Identifier mechanism to dif ferentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a
transaction originates from an entity . However , the Security Identifiers are not correctly implemented.
 Extended Description
Systems-On-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement Security Identifiers to dif ferentiate/identify actions originated
from various agents. These actions could be 'read', 'write', 'program', 'reset', 'fetch', 'compute', etc. Security identifiers are generated
and assigned to every agent in the System (SoC) that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another
agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Identifier based on its trust level or privileges.
A broad class of flaws can exist in the Security Identifier process, including but not limited to missing security identifiers, improper
conversion of security identifiers, incorrect generation of security identifiers, etc.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Security Identifier Decoders must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.
Phase: Implementation
Access and programming flows must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.
