CWE-9: J2EE Misconfiguration: W eak Access Permissions for EJB Methods
Weakness ID: 9
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
If elevated access rights are assigned to EJB methods, then an attacker can take advantage of the permissions to exploit the product.
 Extended Description
If the EJB deployment descriptor contains one or more method permissions that grant access to the special ANYONE role, it indicates
that access control for the application has not been fully thought through or that the application is structured in such a way that
reasonable access control restrictions are impossible.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following deployment descriptor grants ANYONE permission to invoke the Employee EJB's method named getSalary().
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; System Configuration
Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to EJB methods. Permission to invoke EJB methods should
not be granted to the ANYONE role.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
