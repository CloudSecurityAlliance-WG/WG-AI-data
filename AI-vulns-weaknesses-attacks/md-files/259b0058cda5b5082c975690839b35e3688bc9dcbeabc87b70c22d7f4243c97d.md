CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing
Weakness ID: 548
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.
 Extended Description
A directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory . The specific risks
and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Files or Directories
Exposing the contents of a directory can lead to an attacker gaining access to source code or
providing useful information for the attacker to devise exploits, such as creation times of files or any
information that may be encoded in file names. The directory listing may also compromise private or
confidential data.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; System Configuration
Recommendations include restricting access to important directories or files by adopting a need to know requirement for both
the document and server root, and turning of f features such as Automatic Directory Listings that could expose private files and
provide information that could be utilized by an attacker when formulating or conducting an attack.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/548.html 2/2Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
