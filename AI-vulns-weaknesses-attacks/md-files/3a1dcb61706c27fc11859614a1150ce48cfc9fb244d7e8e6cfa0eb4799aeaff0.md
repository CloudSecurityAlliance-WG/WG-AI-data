CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
Weakness ID: 1254
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a
comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of
the process for nefarious purposes.
 Extended Description
Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and
responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and
breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred.
With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Consider an example hardware module that checks a user-provided password to grant access to a user . The user-provided password
is compared against a golden value in a byte-by-byte manner .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

bi3/7/24, 2:46 PM CWE - CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1254.html 2/3Since the code breaks on an incorrect entry of password, an attacker can guess the correct password for that byte-check iteration
with few repeat attempts.
To fix this weakness, either the comparison of the entire string should be done all at once, or the attacker is not given an indication
whether pass or fail happened by allowing the comparison to run through all bits before the grant\_access signal is set.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-10482 Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
CVE-2019-10071 Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time
algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
CVE-2014-0984 Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the
first incorrect character , which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that
relies on timing dif ferences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel
attack.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
The hardware designer should ensure that comparison logic is implemented so as to compare in one operation instead in
smaller chunks.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
