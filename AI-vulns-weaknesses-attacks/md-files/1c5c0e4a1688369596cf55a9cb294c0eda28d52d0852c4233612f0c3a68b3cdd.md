CWE-1023: Incomplete Comparison with Missing Factors
Weakness ID: 1023
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs a comparison between entities that must consider multiple factors or characteristics of each entity , but the
comparison does not include one or more of these factors.
 Extended Description
An incomplete comparison can lead to resultant weaknesses, e.g., by operating on the wrong object or making a security decision
without considering a required factor .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Consider an application in which Truck objects are defined to be the same if they have the same make, the same model, and were
manufactured in the same year .
Here, the equals() method only checks the make and model of the Truck objects, but the year of manufacture is not included.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

private String model;
private int year;
public boolean equals(Object o) {
if (o == null) return false;
if (o == this) return true;

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1023.html 2/3Example 2
This example defines a fixed username and password. The AuthenticateUser() function is intended to accept a username and a
password from an untrusted user , and check to ensure that it matches the username and password. If the username and password
match, AuthenticateUser() is intended to indicate that authentication succeeded.
In AuthenticateUser(), the strncmp() call uses the string length of an attacker-provided inPass parameter in order to determine how
many characters to check in the password. So, if the attacker only provides a password of length 1, the check will only examine the
first byte of the application's password before determining success.
As a result, this partial comparison leads to improper authentication ( CWE-287 ).
Any of these passwords would still cause authentication to succeed for the "admin" user:
This significantly reduces the search space for an attacker , making brute force attacks more feasible.
The same problem also applies to the username, so values such as "a" and "adm" will succeed for the username.
While this demonstrative example may not seem realistic, see the Observed Examples for CVE entries that ef fectively reflect this
same weakness.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2005-2782 PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".
CVE-2014-6394 Product does not prevent access to restricted directories due to partial string comparison with a public
directory
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: T esting
Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative
testing.

Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)(bad code) Example Language: C 
/\* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. \*/
char \*username = "admin";
char \*pass = "password";
int AuthenticateUser(char \*inUser, char \*inPass) {
if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {
logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");
return(AUTH\_FAIL);
}
if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {
logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");
return(AUTH\_SUCCESS);
}
else {
logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");

}
}
int main (int argc, char \*\*argv) {
int authResult;
