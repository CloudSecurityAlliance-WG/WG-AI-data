CWE-1334: Unauthorized Error Injection Can Degrade Hardware Redundancy
Weakness ID: 1334
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
An unauthorized agent can inject errors into a redundant block to deprive the system of redundancy or put the system in a degraded
operating mode.
 Extended Description
To ensure the performance and functional reliability of certain components, hardware designers can implement hardware blocks for
redundancy in the case that others fail. This redundant block can be prevented from performing as intended if the design allows
unauthorized agents to inject errors into it. In this way , a path with injected errors may become unavailable to serve as a redundant
channel. This may put the system into a degraded mode of operation which could be exploited by a subsequent attack.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1334.html 2/2Disallow error injection in modes which are expected to be used for normal run-time operation. Provide access controls on
interfaces for injecting errors.
Phase: Integration
Add an access control layer atop any unprotected interfaces for injecting errors.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
