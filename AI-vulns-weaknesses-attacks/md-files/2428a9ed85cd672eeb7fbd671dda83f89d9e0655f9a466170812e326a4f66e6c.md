 Description
Allowing a .NET application to run at potentially escalated levels of access to the underlying operating and file systems can be
dangerous and result in various forms of attacks.
 Extended Description
.NET server applications can optionally execute using the identity of the user authenticated to the client. The intention of this
functionality is to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application code. Authentication is done by the
underlying web server (Microsoft Internet Information Service IIS), which passes the authenticated token, or unauthenticated
anonymous token, to the .NET application. Using the token to impersonate the client, the application then relies on the settings within
the NTFS directories and files to control access. Impersonation enables the application, on the server running the .NET application, to
both execute code and access resources in the context of the authenticated and authorized user .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/520.html 2/2Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
