LLM Plugin Compromise
Summary󰅂 󰅂
Adversaries may use their access to an LLM that is part of a
larger system to compromise connected plugins. LLMs are
often connected to other services or resources via plugins to
increase their capabilities. Plugins may include integrations
with other applications, access to public or private data
sources, and the ability to execute code.
This may allow adversaries to execute API calls to
integrated applications or plugins, providing the adversary
with increased privileges on the system. Adversaries may
take advantage of connected data sources to retrieve
sensitive information. They may also use an LLM
integrated with a command or script interpreter to execute
arbitrary instructions.ID: AML.T0053
