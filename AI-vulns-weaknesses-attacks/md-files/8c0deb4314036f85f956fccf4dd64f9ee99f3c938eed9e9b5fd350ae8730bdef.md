CWE-1177: Use of Prohibited Code
Weakness ID: 1177
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a function, library , or third party component that has been explicitly prohibited, whether by the developer or the
customer .
 Extended Description
The developer - or customers - may wish to restrict or eliminate use of a function, library , or third party component for any number of
reasons, including real or suspected vulnerabilities; dif ficulty to use securely; export controls or license requirements; obsolete or
poorly-maintained code; internal code being scheduled for deprecation; etc.
To reduce risk of vulnerabilities, the developer might maintain a list of "banned" functions that programmers must avoid using because
the functions are dif ficult or impossible to use securely . This issue can also make the product more costly and dif ficult to maintain.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The code below calls the gets() function to read in data from the command line.
However , gets() is inherently unsafe, because it copies all input from STDIN to the buf fer without checking size. This allows the user
to provide a string that is larger than the buf fer size, resulting in an overflow condition.
Example 2
The following code attempts to create a local copy of a buf fer to perform some manipulations to the data.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1177.html 2/2However , the programmer does not ensure that the size of the data pointed to by string will fit in the local buf fer and copies the data
with the potentially dangerous strcpy() function. This may result in a buf fer overflow condition if an attacker can influence the contents
of the string parameter .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2007-1470 Library has multiple buf fer overflows using sprintf() and strcpy()
CVE-2007-4004 FTP client uses inherently insecure gets() function and is setuid root on some systems, allowing buf fer
overflow
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
