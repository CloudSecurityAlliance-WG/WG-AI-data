 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following C/C++ example the method processMessageFromSocket() will get a message from a socket, placed into a buf fer, and
will parse the contents of the buf fer into a structure that contains the message length and the message body . A for loop is used to
copy the message body into a local character string which will be passed to another method for processing.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: C 
int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
int success;
char buffer[BUFFER\_SIZE];
char message[MESSAGE\_SIZE];
// get message from socket and store into buffer
//Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER\_SIZE
if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER\_SIZE) > 0) {
// place contents of the buffer into message structure
ExMessage \*msg = recastBuffer(buffer);
// copy message body into string for processing
int index;
for (index = 0; index < msg->msgLength; index++) {
message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];
}
message[index] = '\0';
// process message
success = processMessage(message);
}
return success;

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/240.html 2/2However , the message length variable from the structure is used as the condition for ending the for loop without validating that the
message length variable accurately reflects the length of the message body ( CWE-606 ). This can result in a buf fer over-read ( CWE-
125) by reading from memory beyond the bounds of the buf fer if the message length variable indicates a length that is longer than the
size of a message body ( CWE-130 ).
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2014-0160 Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter ( CWE-130 ) enabling an out-of-
bounds read ( CWE-126 ), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other
sensitive data.
CVE-2009-2299 Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large
Content-Length value but no POST data.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
