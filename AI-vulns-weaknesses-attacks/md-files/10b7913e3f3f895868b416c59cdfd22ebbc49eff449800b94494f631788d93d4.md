CWE-586: Explicit Call to Finalize()
Weakness ID: 586
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product makes an explicit call to the finalize() method from outside the finalizer .
 Extended Description
While the Java Language Specification allows an object's finalize() method to be called from outside the finalizer , doing so is usually a
bad idea. For example, calling finalize() explicitly means that finalize() will be called more than once: the first time will be the explicit
call and the last time will be the call that is made after the object is garbage collected.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/586.html 2/2Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
