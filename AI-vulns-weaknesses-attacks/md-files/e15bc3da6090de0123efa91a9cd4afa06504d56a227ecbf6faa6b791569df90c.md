CWE-198: Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering
Weakness ID: 198
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not account for byte ordering (e.g. big-endian and little-endian)
when processing the input, causing an incorrect number or value to be used.

 Detection Methods
Black Box
Because byte ordering bugs are usually very noticeable even with normal inputs, this bug is more likely to occur in rarely
triggered error conditions, making them dif ficult to detect using black box methods.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
