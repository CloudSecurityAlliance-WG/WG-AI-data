Summary
Pre-Print repositories, such as arXiv , contain the latest academic research papers
that haven't been peer reviewed. They may contain research notes, or technical
reports that aren't typically published in journals or conference proceedings. Pre-
print repositories also serve as a central location to share papers that have been
accepted to journals. Searching pre-print repositories provide adversaries with a
relatively up-to-date view of what researchers in the victim organization are working
on.
