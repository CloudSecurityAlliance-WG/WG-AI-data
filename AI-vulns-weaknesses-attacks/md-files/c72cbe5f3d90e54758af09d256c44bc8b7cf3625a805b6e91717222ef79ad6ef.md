CWE-834: Excessive Iteration
Weakness ID: 834
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs an iteration or loop without suf ficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.
 Extended Description
If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker , this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or
memory . In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely af fect the
product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory); DoS: Amplification; DoS: Crash,
Exit, or Restart
Excessive looping will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory .
The product's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond. If limited resources such as
memory are consumed for each iteration, the loop may eventually cause a crash or program exit due to
exhaustion of resources, such as an out-of-memory error .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In this example a mistake exists in the code where the exit condition contained in flg is never called. This results in the function calling
itself over and over again until the stack is exhausted.
Note that the only dif ference between the Good and Bad examples is that the recursion flag will change value and cause the recursive
call to return.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: C 
void do\_something\_recursive (int flg)
{
... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
if (flg) { do\_something\_recursive (flg); } // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do\_something\_recursive (flag);
(good code) Example Language: C 
void do\_something\_recursive (int flg)

... // Do some real work here
// Modify value of flg on done condition
if (flg) { do\_something\_recursive (flg); } // returns when flg changes to 0

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/834.html 2/3Example 2
For this example, the method isReorderNeeded is part of a bookstore application that determines if a particular book needs to be
reordered based on the current inventory count and the rate at which the book is being sold.
However , the while loop will become an infinite loop if the rateSold input parameter has a value of zero since the inventoryCount will
never fall below the minimumCount. In this case the input parameter should be validated to ensure that a value of zero does not
cause an infinite loop, as in the following code.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2011-1027 Chain: of f-by-one error ( CWE-193 ) leads to infinite loop ( CWE-835 ) using invalid hex-encoded
characters.
CVE-2006-6499 Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - "bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math
[CWE-1339 ] to exit the loop [ CWE-835 ]"
 Detection Methods
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Fuzz Tester
Framework-based Fuzzer
Forced Path Execution
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of sourcedo\_something\_recursive (flag);
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public boolean isReorderNeeded(String bookISBN, int rateSold) {
boolean isReorder = false;
int minimumCount = 10;
int days = 0;
// get inventory count for book
int inventoryCount = inventory.getIventoryCount(bookISBN);
// find number of days until inventory count reaches minimum
while (inventoryCount > minimumCount) {
inventoryCount = inventoryCount - rateSold;
days++;
}
// if number of days within reorder timeframe
// set reorder return boolean to true
if (days > 0 && days < 5) {
isReorder = true;
}
return isReorder;
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 
public boolean isReorderNeeded(String bookISBN, int rateSold) {
...
// validate rateSold variable
if (rateSold < 1) {
return isReorder;
}
