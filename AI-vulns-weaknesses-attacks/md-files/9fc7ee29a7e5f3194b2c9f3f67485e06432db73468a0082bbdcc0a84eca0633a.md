CWE-1051: Initialization with Hard-Coded Network Resource Configuration Data
Weakness ID: 1051
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product initializes data using hard-coded values that act as network resource identifiers.
 Extended Description
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably , e.g. if it runs in an environment does not use the hard-coded network
resource identifiers. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability .
