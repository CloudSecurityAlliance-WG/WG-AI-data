 Description
The product does not maintain equal hashcodes for equal objects.
 Extended Description
Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality . One of these invariants is that equal objects must have
equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().

Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: Other
If this invariant is not upheld, it is likely to cause trouble if objects of this class are stored in a collection. If
the objects of the class in question are used as a key in a Hashtable or if they are inserted into a Map or
Set, it is critical that equal objects have equal hashcodes.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Both Equals() and Hashcode() should be defined.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
