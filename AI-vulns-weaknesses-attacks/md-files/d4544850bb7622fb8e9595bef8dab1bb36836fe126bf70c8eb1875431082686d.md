CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a
Downstream Component ('Injection')
Weakness ID: 74
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream
component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when
it is sent to a downstream component.
 Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively . It is the lack of
verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide
variety of issues -- all mitigated in very dif ferent ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this
reason, the most ef fective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection
weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the
injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by
sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buf fer overflows, and many other flaws, involve
the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/74.html 2/4Injection attacks are characterized by the ability to significantly change the flow of a given
process, and in some cases, to the execution of arbitrary code.
Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: Other
Data injection attacks lead to loss of data integrity in nearly all cases as the control-plane data
injected is always incidental to data recall or writing.
Non-RepudiationTechnical Impact: Hide Activities
Often the actions performed by injected control code are unlogged.
 Likelihood Of Exploit
High
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This example code intends to take the name of a user and list the contents of that user's home directory . It is subject to the first
variant of OS command injection.
The $userName variable is not checked for malicious input. An attacker could set the $userName variable to an arbitrary OS
command such as:
Which would result in $command being:
Since the semi-colon is a command separator in Unix, the OS would first execute the ls command, then the rm command, deleting the
entire file system.
Also note that this example code is vulnerable to Path Traversal ( CWE-22 ) and Untrusted Search Path ( CWE-426 ) attacks.
Example 2
Consider the following program. It intends to perform an "ls -l" on an input filename. The validate\_name() subroutine performs
validation on the input to make sure that only alphanumeric and "-" characters are allowed, which avoids path traversal ( CWE-22 ) and
OS command injection ( CWE-78 ) weaknesses. Only filenames like "abc" or "d-e-f" are intended to be allowed.
However , validate\_name() alows filenames that begin with a "-". An adversary could supply a filename like "-aR", producing the "ls -l -
aR" command ( CWE-88 ), thereby getting a full recursive listing of the entire directory and all of its sub-directories.
There are a couple possible mitigations for this weakness. One would be to refactor the code to avoid using system() altogether ,
instead relying on internal functions.(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
$userName = $\_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;
system($command);
(attack code) 
;rm -rf /
(result) 
ls -l /home/;rm -rf /
(bad code) Example Language: Perl 
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do\_listing($arg);
sub do\_listing {
my($fname) = @\_;
if (! validate\_name($fname)) {
print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
return;
}
# build command
my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
system($cmd);
}
sub validate\_name {
my($name) = @\_;
if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {
return(1);
}
else {
return(0);
}

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/74.html 3/4Another option could be to add a "--" argument to the ls command, such as "ls -l --", so that any remaining arguments are treated as
filenames, causing any leading "-" to be treated as part of a filename instead of another option.
Another fix might be to change the regular expression used in validate\_name to force the first character of the filename to be a letter
or number , such as:

allowing for code execution.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Requirements
Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.
Phase: Implementation
Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter control-plane syntax from all input.

Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Notes
Theoretical
Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem ( CWE-20 ) because many people do not distinguish between the
consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However , input validation is
only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input
(good code) Example Language: Perl 
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) ...3/7/24, 3:08 PM CWE - CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component …
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/74.html 4/4validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input
validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.
