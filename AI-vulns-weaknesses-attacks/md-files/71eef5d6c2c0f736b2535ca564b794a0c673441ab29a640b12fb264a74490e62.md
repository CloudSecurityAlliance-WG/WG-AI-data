 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
This weakness can allow an attacker to access resources which are not otherwise accessible
without proper authentication.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code authenticates users.
The authentication mechanism implemented relies on an IP address for source validation. If an attacker is able to spoof the IP , they
may be able to bypass the authentication mechanism.
Example 2
Both of these examples check if a request is from a trusted address before responding to the request.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: C 
sd = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_DGRAM, 0);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/290.html 2/3The code only verifies the address as stored in the request packet. An attacker can spoof this address, thus impersonating a trusted
client.
Example 3
The following code samples use a DNS lookup in order to decide whether or not an inbound request is from a trusted host. If an
attacker can poison the DNS cache, they can gain trusted status.
IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of
the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to
sniff the traf fic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required snif fing, attackers typically
attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by
using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today . In summary , IP address verification can be a
useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-30319 S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which
can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
CVE-2009-1048 VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
