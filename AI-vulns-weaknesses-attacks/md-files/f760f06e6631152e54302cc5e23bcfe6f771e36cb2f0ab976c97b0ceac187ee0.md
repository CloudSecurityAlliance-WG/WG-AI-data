CWE-1115: Source Code Element without Standard Prologue
Weakness ID: 1115
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The source code contains elements such as source files that do not consistently provide a prologue or header that has been
standardized for the project.
 Extended Description
The lack of a prologue can make it more dif ficult to accurately and quickly understand the associated code. Standard prologues or
headers may contain information such as module name, version number , author , date, purpose, function, assumptions, limitations,
accuracy considerations, etc.
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product due to insuf ficient analyzability , which indirectly af fects security by making it
more dif ficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
