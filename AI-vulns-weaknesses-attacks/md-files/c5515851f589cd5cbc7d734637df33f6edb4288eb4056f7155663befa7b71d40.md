Proxy via Gathered ML Artifacts
Summary󰅂 󰅂 󰅂
Proxy models may be trained from ML artifacts (such as
data, model architectures, and pre-trained models) that are
representative of the target model gathered by the
adversary. This can be used to develop attacks that require
higher levels of access than the adversary has available or
as a means to validate pre-existing attacks without
interacting with the target model.ID: AML.T0005.000
