View customized information:
 Description
The product contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.
 Extended Description
Malicious flaws have acquired colorful names, including Trojan horse, trapdoor , timebomb, and logic-bomb. A developer might insert
malicious code with the intent to subvert the security of a product or its host system at some time in the future. It generally refers to a
program that performs a useful service but exploits rights of the program's user in a way the user does not intend.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/506.html 2/3Remove the malicious code and start an ef fort to ensure that no more malicious code exists. This may require a detailed review
of all code, as it is possible to hide a serious attack in only one or two lines of code. These lines may be located almost
anywhere in an application and may have been intentionally obfuscated by the attacker .
 Detection Methods
Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies
Generated Code Inspection
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Automated Monitored Execution
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Automated Static Analysis
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Origin Analysis
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial

 Notes
Terminology
The term "T rojan horse" was introduced by Dan Edwards and recorded by James Anderson [18] to characterize a particular
computer security threat; it has been redefined many times [4,18-20].
