CWE-563: Assignment to V ariable without Use
Weakness ID: 563
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store.
 Extended Description
After the assignment, the variable is either assigned another value or goes out of scope. It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial,
but it is also possible that the unused variable points out a bug.
 Alternate T erms
Unused V ariable

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation; Varies by Context
This weakness could be an indication of a bug in the program or a deprecated variable that was not
removed and is an indication of poor quality . This could lead to further bugs and the introduction of
weaknesses.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code excerpt assigns to the variable r and then overwrites the value without using it.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Remove unused variables from the code.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/563.html 2/2Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
