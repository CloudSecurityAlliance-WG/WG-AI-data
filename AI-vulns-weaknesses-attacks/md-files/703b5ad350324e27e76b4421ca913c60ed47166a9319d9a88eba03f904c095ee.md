CWE-579: J2EE Bad Practices: Non-serializable Object Stored in Session
Weakness ID: 579
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product stores a non-serializable object as an HttpSession attribute, which can hurt reliability .
 Extended Description
A J2EE application can make use of multiple JVMs in order to improve application reliability and performance. In order to make the
multiple JVMs appear as a single application to the end user , the J2EE container can replicate an HttpSession object across multiple
JVMs so that if one JVM becomes unavailable another can step in and take its place without disrupting the flow of the application.
This is only possible if all session data is serializable, allowing the session to be duplicated between the JVMs.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Java (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following class adds itself to the session, but because it is not serializable, the session can no longer be replicated.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
In order for session replication to work, the values the product stores as attributes in the session must implement the
Serializable interface.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/579.html 2/2Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
