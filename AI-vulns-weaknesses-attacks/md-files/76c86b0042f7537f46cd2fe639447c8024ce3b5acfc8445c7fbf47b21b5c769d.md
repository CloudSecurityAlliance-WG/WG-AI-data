Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be automatically replenished, but the product
does not properly restrict the amount of power that its operation consumes.
 Extended Description
In environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such as a battery , which cannot be
automatically replenished by the product itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the
product uses too much power too quickly , then this could cause the device (and subsequently , the product) to stop functioning until
power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner because of increased power costs.
Normal operation of an application will consume power . However , in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume
more power than intended, using components such as:
Display
CPU
Disk I/O
GPS
Sound
Microphone
USB interface

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
