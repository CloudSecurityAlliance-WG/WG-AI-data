CWE-567: Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context
Weakness ID: 567
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads, which can lead to undefined
behavior and unpredictable data changes.
 Extended Description
Within servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical
programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be
influenced by an attacker , one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a dif ferent thread that is
also using the data within the variable.
Note that this weakness is not unique to servlets.

AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data; Modify Application Data; DoS: Instability; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
If the shared variable contains sensitive data, it may be manipulated or displayed in another user
session. If this data is used to control the application, its value can be manipulated to cause the
application to crash or perform poorly .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code implements a basic counter for how many times the page has been accesed.
Consider when two separate threads, Thread A and Thread B, concurrently handle two dif ferent requests:About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/567.html 2/3Assume this is the first occurrence of doGet, so the value of count is 0.
doGet() is called within Thread A.
The execution of doGet() in Thread A continues to the point AFTER the value of the count variable is read, then incremented,
but BEFORE it is saved back to count. At this stage, the incremented value is 1, but the value of count is 0.
doGet() is called within Thread B, and due to a higher thread priority , Thread B progresses to the point where the count
variable is accessed (where it is still 0), incremented, and saved. After the save, count is 1.
Thread A continues. It saves the intermediate, incremented value to the count variable - but the incremented value is 1, so
count is "re-saved" to 1.
At this point, both Thread A and Thread B print that one hit has been seen, even though two separate requests have been processed.
The value of count should be 2, not 1.
While this example does not have any real serious implications, if the shared variable in question is used for resource tracking, then
resource consumption could occur . Other scenarios exist.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Remove the use of static variables used between servlets. If this cannot be avoided, use synchronized access for these
variables.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
