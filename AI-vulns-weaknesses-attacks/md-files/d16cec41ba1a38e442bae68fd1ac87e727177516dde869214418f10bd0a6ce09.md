CWE-528: Exposure of Core Dump File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
Weakness ID: 528
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product generates a core dump file in a directory , archive, or other resource that is stored, transferred, or otherwise made
accessible to unauthorized actors.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
 Relevant to the view "Architectural Concepts" (CWE-1008)
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Operation OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data; Read Files or Directories
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: System Configuration
Protect the core dump files from unauthorized access.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/528.html 2/2Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
