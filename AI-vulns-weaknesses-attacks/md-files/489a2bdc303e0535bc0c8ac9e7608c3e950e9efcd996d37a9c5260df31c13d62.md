CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
Weakness ID: 1325
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not
properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.
 Extended Description
While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an
array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory
consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.
 Alternate T erms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion,"
which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence
of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325 .

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)
Not controlling memory allocation can result in a request for too much system memory , possibly leading
to a crash of the application due to out-of-memory conditions, or the consumption of a large amount of
memory on the system.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This example contains a small allocation of stack memory . When the program was first constructed, the number of times this memory
was allocated was probably inconsequential and presented no problem. Over time, as the number of objects in the database grow ,
the number of allocations will grow - eventually consuming the available stack, i.e. "stack exhaustion." An attacker who is able to add
elements to the database could cause stack exhaustion more rapidly than assumed by the developer .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1325.html 2/2Since this uses alloca(), it allocates memory directly on the stack. If end\_limit is large enough, then the stack can be entirely
consumed.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2020-36049 JavaScript-based packet decoder uses concatenation of many small strings, causing out-of-memory
(OOM) condition
CVE-2019-20176 Product allocates a new buf fer on the stack for each file in a directory , allowing stack exhaustion
CVE-2013-1591 Chain: an integer overflow ( CWE-190 ) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop ( CWE-835 )
which sequentially allocates buf fers without limits ( CWE-1325 ) until the stack is full.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Ensure multiple allocations of the same kind of object are properly tracked - possibly across multiple sessions, requests, or
messages. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration
option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary .
Phase: Operation
Run the program using system-provided resource limits for memory . This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the
impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
