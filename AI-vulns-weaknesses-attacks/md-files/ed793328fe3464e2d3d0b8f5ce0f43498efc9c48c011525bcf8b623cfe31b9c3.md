CWE-820: Missing Synchronization
Weakness ID: 820
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource.
 Extended Description
If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might
lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/820.html 2/2One might expect the code to print out something like:
PARENT
child
However , because the parent and child are executing concurrently , and stdout is flushed each time a character is printed, the output
might be mixed together , such as:

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other
mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency , race conditions, reentrant
functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667 , CWE-820 , CWE-821 , and others - may need to be modified
significantly , along with their relationships.
