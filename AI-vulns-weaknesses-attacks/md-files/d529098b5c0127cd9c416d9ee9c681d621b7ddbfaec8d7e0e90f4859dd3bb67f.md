Weakness ID: 1063
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A static code block creates an instance of a class.
 Extended Description
This pattern identifies situations where a storable data element or member data element is initialized with a value in a block of code
which is declared as static.
This issue can make the product perform more slowly by performing initialization before it is needed. If the relevant code is reachable
by an attacker , then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability .
