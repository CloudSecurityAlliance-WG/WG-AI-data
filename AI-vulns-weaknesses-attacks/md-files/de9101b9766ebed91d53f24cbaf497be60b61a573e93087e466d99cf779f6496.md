CWE-584: Return Inside Finally Block
Weakness ID: 584
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code has a return statement inside a finally block, which will cause any thrown exception in the try block to be discarded.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following code excerpt, the IllegalArgumentException will never be delivered to the caller . The finally block will cause the
exception to be discarded.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Do not use a return statement inside the finally block. The finally block should have "cleanup" code.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
