 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-1374 The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.
CVE-2000-0979 The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by
sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.
CVE-2001-0088 Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array , which inadvertently sets the password to a
single character , allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative
privileges.

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
