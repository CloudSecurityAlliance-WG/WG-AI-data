View customized information:
 Description
When converting from one data type to another , such as long to integer , data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces
unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur .

The program could wind up using the wrong number and generate incorrect results. If the number is used
to allocate resources or make a security decision, then this could introduce a vulnerability .
 Likelihood Of Exploit

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example, a float literal is cast to an integer , thus causing a loss of precision.
Example 2
This code adds a float and an integer together , casting the result to an integer .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/681.html 2/3Normally , PHP will preserve the precision of this operation, making $result = 4.8345. After the cast to int, it is reasonable to expect
PHP to follow rounding convention and set $result = 5. However , the explicit cast to int always rounds DOWN, so the final value of
$result is 4. This behavior may have unintended consequences.
Example 3
In this example the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an
unsigned int, amount will be implicitly converted to unsigned.
If the error condition in the code above is met, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit
integers.
Example 4
In this example, depending on the return value of accecssmainframe(), the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is
returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value, amount will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number .
If the return value of accessmainframe() is -1, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit
integers.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-2639 Chain: integer coercion error ( CWE-192 ) prevents a return value from indicating an error , leading to
out-of-bounds write ( CWE-787 )
CVE-2021-43537 Chain: in a web browser , an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer ( CWE-681 ) and
potentially leading to an integer overflow ( CWE-190 ). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap
memory corruption ( CWE-122 )
CVE-2007-4268 Chain: integer signedness error ( CWE-195 ) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow
(CWE-122 )
CVE-2007-4988 Chain: signed short width value in image processor is sign extended during conversion to unsigned int,
which leads to integer overflow and heap-based buf fer overflow .
CVE-2009-0231 Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buf fer overflow .
CVE-2008-3282 Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document
processor causes incorrect index to be generated.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Avoid making conversion between numeric types. Always check for the allowed ranges.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
