CWE-594: J2EE Framework: Saving Unserializable Objects to Disk

View customized information:
 Description
When the J2EE container attempts to write unserializable objects to disk there is no guarantee that the process will complete
successfully .
 Extended Description
In heavy load conditions, most J2EE application frameworks flush objects to disk to manage memory requirements of incoming
requests. For example, session scoped objects, and even application scoped objects, are written to disk when required. While these
application frameworks do the real work of writing objects to disk, they do not enforce that those objects be serializable, thus leaving
the web application vulnerable to crashes induced by serialization failure. An attacker may be able to mount a denial of service attack
by sending enough requests to the server to force the web application to save objects to disk.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data
Data represented by unserializable objects can be corrupted.
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
Non-serializability of objects can lead to system crash.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example, a Customer Entity JavaBean provides access to customer information in a database for a business
application. The Customer Entity JavaBean is used as a session scoped object to return customer information to a Session EJB.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/594.html 2/2However , the Customer Entity JavaBean is an unserialized object which can cause serialization failure and crash the application when
the J2EE container attempts to write the object to the system. Session scoped objects must implement the Serializable interface to
ensure that the objects serialize properly .
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
All objects that become part of session and application scope must implement the java.io.Serializable interface to ensure
serializability of containing objects.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
