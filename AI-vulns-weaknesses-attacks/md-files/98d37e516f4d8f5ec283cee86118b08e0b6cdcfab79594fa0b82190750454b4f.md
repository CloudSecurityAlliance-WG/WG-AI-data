CWE-683: Function Call W ith Incorrect Order of Arguments
Weakness ID: 683
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the arguments in an incorrect order , leading to resultant
weaknesses.
 Extended Description
While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called
function accepts variable numbers or types of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or environments
that do not enforce strong typing.

Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 628 Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation This problem typically occurs when the programmer makes a typo, or copy and paste errors.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following PHP method authenticates a user given a username/password combination but is called with the parameters in reverse
order .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2006-7049 Application calls functions with arguments in the wrong order , allowing attacker to bypass intended
access restrictions.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Use the function, procedure, or routine as specified.
Phase: T esting
Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the
product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the
incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected
argument type.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
