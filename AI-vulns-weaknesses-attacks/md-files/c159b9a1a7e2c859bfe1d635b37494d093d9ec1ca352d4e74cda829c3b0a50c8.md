View customized information:
 Description
The product has a method that is declared public, but returns a reference to a private data structure, which could then be modified in
unexpected ways.

Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data
The contents of the data structure can be modified from outside the intended scope.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Here, a public method in a Java class returns a reference to a private array . Given that arrays in Java are mutable, any modifications
made to the returned reference would be reflected in the original private array .
Example 2
In this example, the Color class defines functions that return non-const references to private members (an array type and an integer
type), which are then arbitrarily altered from outside the control of the class.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Declare the method private.
Phase: Implementation
Clone the member data and keep an unmodified version of the data private to the object.
Phase: Implementation
Use public setter methods that govern how a private member can be modified.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
