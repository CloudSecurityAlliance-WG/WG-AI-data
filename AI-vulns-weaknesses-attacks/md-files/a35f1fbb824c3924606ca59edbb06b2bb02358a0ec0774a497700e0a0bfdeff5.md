CWE-66: Improper Handling of File Names that Identify V irtual Resources
Weakness ID: 66
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a file name that identifies a "virtual" resource that is not directly specified within
the directory that is associated with the file name, causing the product to perform file-based operations on a resource that is not a file.
 Extended Description
Virtual file names are represented like normal file names, but they are ef fectively aliases for other resources that do not behave like
normal files. Depending on their functionality , they could be alternate entities. They are not necessarily listed in directories.

Reference Description
CVE-1999-0278 In IIS, remote attackers can obtain source code for ASP files by appending "::$DA TA" to the URL.
CVE-2004-1084 Server allows remote attackers to read files and resource fork content via HTTP requests to certain
special file names related to multiple data streams in HFS+.
CVE-2002-0106 Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a series of requests to .JSP files that
contain an MS-DOS device name.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
3/7/24, 3:07 PM CWE - CWE-66: Improper Handling of File Names that Identify Virtual Resources (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/66.html 3/3Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
