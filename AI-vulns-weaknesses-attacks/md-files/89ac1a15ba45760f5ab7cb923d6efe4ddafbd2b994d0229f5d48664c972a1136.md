CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
Weakness ID: 130
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent
with the actual length of the associated data.
 Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the
input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly , malicious ways. One of the
possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of
application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks
such as buf fer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following C/C++ example the method processMessageFromSocket() will get a message from a socket, placed into a buf fer, and
will parse the contents of the buf fer into a structure that contains the message length and the message body . A for loop is used to
copy the message body into a local character string which will be passed to another method for processing.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/130.html 2/4However , the message length variable from the structure is used as the condition for ending the for loop without validating that the
message length variable accurately reflects the length of the message body ( CWE-606 ). This can result in a buf fer over-read ( CWE-
125) by reading from memory beyond the bounds of the buf fer if the message length variable indicates a length that is longer than the
size of a message body ( CWE-130 ).
 Observed Examples

SAM\_UAS\_CHANGE request with a length value that is larger than the number of structures that are
provided.

remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malicious session file (.ht), web site, or Telnet URL
contained in an e-mail message, triggering a buf fer overflow .
CVE-2003-0327 Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a remote password array with an invalid
length, which triggers a heap-based buf fer overflow .int success;
char buffer[BUFFER\_SIZE];
char message[MESSAGE\_SIZE];
// get message from socket and store into buffer
//Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER\_SIZE
if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER\_SIZE) > 0) {
// place contents of the buffer into message structure
ExMessage \*msg = recastBuffer(buffer);
// copy message body into string for processing

message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];
}
message[index] = '\0';
// process message

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
When processing structured incoming data containing a size field followed by raw data, ensure that you identify and resolve any
inconsistencies between the size field and the actual size of the data.
Phase: Implementation
Do not let the user control the size of the buf fer.
Phase: Implementation
Validate that the length of the user-supplied data is consistent with the buf fer size.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
