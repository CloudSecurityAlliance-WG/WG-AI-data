 Description
Two separate operations in a product require dif ferent amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and
reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.
 Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the
product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing dif ferences to infer certain
properties about a private key , making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies ef fectively form a timing side channel.

Example 1
Consider an example hardware module that checks a user-provided password to grant access to a user . The user-provided password
is compared against a golden value in a byte-by-byte manner .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/208.html 2/3Since the code breaks on an incorrect entry of password, an attacker can guess the correct password for that byte-check iteration
with few repeat attempts.
To fix this weakness, either the comparison of the entire string should be done all at once, or the attacker is not given an indication
whether pass or fail happened by allowing the comparison to run through all bits before the grant\_access signal is set.
Example 2
In this example, the attacker observes how long an authentication takes when the user types in the correct password.
When the attacker tries their own values, they can first try strings of various length. When they find a string of the right length, the
computation will take a bit longer , because the for loop will run at least once. Additionally , with this code, the attacker can possibly
learn one character of the password at a time, because when they guess the first character right, the computation will take longer than
a wrong guesses. Such an attack can break even the most sophisticated password with a few hundred guesses.
Note that in this example, the actual password must be handled in constant time as far as the attacker is concerned, even if the actual
password is of an unusual length. This is one reason why it is good to use an algorithm that, among other things, stores a seeded
cryptographic one-way hash of the password, then compare the hashes, which will always be of the same length.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-10071 Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time
algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
CVE-2019-10482 Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
CVE-2014-0984 Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the
first incorrect character , which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that
relies on timing dif ferences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel
attack.
CVE-2003-0078 SSL implementation does not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect block cipher padding is used,
which causes an information leak (timing discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic
attacks that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to
extraction of the original plaintext, aka the "V audenay timing attack."
CVE-2000-1117 Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by
measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.
CVE-2003-0637 Product uses a shorter timeout for a non-existent user than a valid user , which makes it easier for
remote attackers to guess usernames and conduct brute force password guessing.
CVE-2003-0190 Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote
attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.
CVE-2004-1602 FTP server responds in a dif ferent amount of time when a given username exists, which allows remote
attackers to identify valid usernames by timing the server response.
CVE-2005-0918 Browser allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files by setting the src property
to the target filename and using Javascript to determine if the web page immediately stops loading,
which indicates whether the file exists or not.assign check\_pass[i] = 0;

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
