CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
Weakness ID: 923
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not
properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.
 Extended Description
Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a dif ferent system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as
the intended endpoint.
While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication
channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms

Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Integrity
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
If an attacker can spoof the endpoint, the attacker gains all the privileges that were intended for the
original endpoint.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/923.html 2/3Silverlight clientaccesspolicy .xml :
These entries are far too permissive, allowing any Flash or Silverlight application to send requests. A malicious application hosted on
any other web site will be able to send requests on behalf of any user tricked into executing it.
Example 2
This Android application will remove a user account when it receives an intent to do so:
This application does not check the origin of the intent, thus allowing any malicious application to remove a user . Always check the
origin of an intent, or create an allowlist of trusted applications using the manifest.xml file.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-30319 S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which
can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
CVE-2022-22547 A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used
for information gathering
CVE-2022-4390 A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is
enabled by default
CVE-2012-2292 Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which
allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy .
CVE-2012-5810 Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.
CVE-2014-1266 chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-
Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561
(Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate V alidation) -> CWE-393 (Return of W rong Status
Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
CVE-2000-1218 DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query , leading to cache poisoning
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
