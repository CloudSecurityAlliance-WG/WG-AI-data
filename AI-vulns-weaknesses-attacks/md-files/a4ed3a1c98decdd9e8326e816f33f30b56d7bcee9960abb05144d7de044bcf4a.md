CWE-1059: Insufficient T echnical Documentation
Weakness ID: 1059
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not contain suf ficient technical or engineering documentation (whether on paper or in electronic form) that contains
descriptions of all the relevant software/hardware elements of the product, such as its usage, structure, architectural components,
interfaces, design, implementation, configuration, operation, etc.
 Extended Description
When technical documentation is limited or lacking, products are more dif ficult to maintain. This indirectly af fects security by making it
more dif ficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
When using time-limited or labor-limited third-party/in-house security consulting services (such as threat modeling, vulnerability
discovery , or pentesting), insuf ficient documentation can force those consultants to invest unnecessary time in learning how the
product is organized, instead of focusing their expertise on finding the flaws or suggesting ef fective mitigations.
With respect to hardware design, the lack of a formal, final manufacturer reference can make it dif ficult or impossible to evaluate the
final product, including post-manufacture verification. One cannot ensure that design functionality or operation is within acceptable
tolerances, conforms to specifications, and is free from unexpected behavior . Hardware-related documentation may include
engineering artifacts such as hardware description language (HDLs), netlists, Gerber files, Bills of Materials, EDA (Electronic Design
Automation) tool files, etc.

3/7/24, 2:42 PM CWE - CWE-1059: Insuﬃcient Technical Documentation (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1059.html 2/3OtherTechnical Impact: Varies by Context; Hide Activities; Reduce Reliability; Quality Degradation; Reduce Maintainability
Without a method of verification, one cannot be sure that everything only functions as expected.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-3203 A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface
(CWE-1059 ), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default ( CWE-912 ).
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Documentation; Architecture and Design
Ensure that design documentation is detailed enough to allow for post-manufacturing verification.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Memberships
Nature Type ID Name
MemberOf 1368 ICS Dependencies (& Architecture): External Digital Systems
MemberOf 1371 ICS Supply Chain: Poorly Documented or Undocumented Features
MemberOf 1375 ICS Engineering (Construction/Deployment): Gaps in Details/Data
MemberOf 1412 Comprehensive Categorization: Poor Coding Practices
 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
Comments:
Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.
