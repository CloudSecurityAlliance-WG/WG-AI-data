CWE-1222: Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks
Weakness ID: 1222
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product defines a large address region protected from modification by the same register lock control bit. This results in a conflict
between the functional requirement that some addresses need to be writable by software during operation and the security
requirement that the system configuration lock bit must be set during the boot process.
 Extended Description
Integrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power
reset by a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. In
hardware design, this is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit which enables/disables writing to a protected set of
registers or address regions. When the programmable lock bit is set, the relevant address region can be implemented as a hardcoded
value in hardware logic that cannot be changed later .
A problem can arise wherein the protected region definition is not granular enough. After the programmable lock bit has been set, then
this new functionality cannot be implemented without change to the hardware design.

Architecture and DesignSuch issues are introduced during hardware architecture and design since software controls and
configuration are defined during these phases and identified later during Testing or System

System security configuration cannot be defined in a way that does not conflict with functional
requirements of device.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
For example, consider a hardware unit with a 32 kilobyte configuration address space where the first 8 kilobyte address contains
security sensitive controls that must only be writable by device bootloader . One way to protect the security configuration could be to
define a 32 bit system configuration locking register (SYS\_LOCK) where each bit lock locks the corresponding 1 kilobyte region.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

3/7/24, 2:45 PM CWE - CWE-1222: Insuﬃcient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1222.html 2/2If a register exists within the first kilobyte address range (e.g. SW\_MODE, address 0x310) and needs to be software writable at
runtime, then this register cannot be written in a securely configured system since SYS\_LOCK register lock bit 0 must be set to
protect other security settings (e.g. SECURITY\_FEA TURE\_ENABLE, address 0x0004). The only fix would be to change the hardware
logic or not set the security lock bit.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
The defining of protected locked registers should be reviewed or tested early in the design phase with software teams to ensure
software flows are not blocked by the security locks.
As an alternative to using register lock control bits and fixed access control regions, the hardware design could use
programmable security access control configuration so that device trusted firmware can configure and change the protected
regions based on software usage and security models.

Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
