 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
Attackers can leverage the additional information provided by a default error page to mount attacks
targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the snippet below , an unchecked runtime exception thrown from within the try block may cause the container to display its default
error page (which may contain a full stack trace, among other things).
Example 2
The mode attribute of the  tag in the W eb.config file defines whether custom or default error pages are used.
In the following insecure ASP.NET application setting, custom error message mode is turned of f. An ASP.NET error message with
detailed stack trace and platform versions will be returned.
A more secure setting is to set the custom error message mode for remote users only . No defaultRedirect error page is specified. The
local user on the web server will see a detailed stack trace. For remote users, an ASP.NET error message with the server customError
configuration setting and the platform version will be returned.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
