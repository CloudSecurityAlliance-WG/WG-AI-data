CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
Weakness ID: 912
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or
command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.
 Extended Description
Hidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, "Easter Eggs" that contain extraneous functionality
such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a
security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack
surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality . Even if it is not easily
accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.
