CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
Weakness ID: 409
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large
output.
 Extended Description
An example of data amplification is a "decompression bomb," a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is
decompressed.

Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Amplification; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource
Consumption (Memory)
System resources, CPU and memory , can be quickly consumed. This can lead to poor system
performance or system crash.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The DTD and the very brief XML below illustrate what is meant by an XML bomb. The ZERO entity contains one character , the letter
A. The choice of entity name ZERO is being used to indicate length equivalent to that exponent on two, that is, the length of ZERO is
2^0. Similarly , ONE refers to ZERO twice, therefore the XML parser will expand ONE to a length of 2, or 2^1. Ultimately , we reach
entity THIR TYTWO, which will expand to 2^32 characters in length, or 4 GB, probably consuming far more data than expected.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
