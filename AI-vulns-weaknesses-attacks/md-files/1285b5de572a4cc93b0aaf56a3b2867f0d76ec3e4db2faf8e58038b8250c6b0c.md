CWE-106: Struts: Plug-in Framework not in Use
Weakness ID: 106
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
When an application does not use an input validation framework such as the Struts V alidator , there is a greater risk of introducing
weaknesses related to insuf ficient input validation.
 Extended Description
Unchecked input is the leading cause of vulnerabilities in J2EE applications. Unchecked input leads to cross-site scripting, process
control, and SQL injection vulnerabilities, among others.
Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native
code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application
to launch a buf fer overflow attack.

Example 1
In the following Java example the class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user input data
from a registration webpage for an online business site. The user will enter registration data and, through the Struts framework, the
RegistrationForm bean will maintain the user data.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/106.html 2/3However , the RegistrationForm class extends the Struts ActionForm class which does use the Struts validator plug-in to provide
validator capabilities. In the following example, the RegistrationForm Java class extends the V alidatorForm and Struts configuration
XML file, struts-config.xml, instructs the application to use the Struts validator plug-in.
The plug-in tag of the Struts configuration XML file includes the name of the validator plug-in to be used and includes a set-property
tag to instruct the application to use the file, validator-rules.xml, for default validation rules and the file, validation.XML, for custom
validation.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Input V alidation
Use an input validation framework such as Struts.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks
Use an input validation framework such as Struts.
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Use the Struts V alidator to validate all program input before it is processed by the application. Ensure that there are no holes in
the configuration of the Struts V alidator . Example uses of the validator include checking to ensure that:
Phone number fields contain only valid characters in phone numbers
Boolean values are only "T" or "F"
Free-form strings are of a reasonable length and composition

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
