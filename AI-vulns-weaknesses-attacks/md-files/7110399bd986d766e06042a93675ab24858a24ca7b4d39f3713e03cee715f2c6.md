CWE-582: Array Declared Public, Final, and Static
Weakness ID: 582
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product declares an array public, final, and static, which is not suf ficient to prevent the array's contents from being modified.
 Extended Description
Because arrays are mutable objects, the final constraint requires that the array object itself be assigned only once, but makes no
guarantees about the values of the array elements. Since the array is public, a malicious program can change the values stored in the
array . As such, in most cases an array declared public, final and static is a bug.

 Background Details
Mobile code, in this case a Java Applet, is code that is transmitted across a network and executed on a remote machine. Because
mobile code developers have little if any control of the environment in which their code will execute, special security concerns become
relevant. One of the biggest environmental threats results from the risk that the mobile code will run side-by-side with other , potentially
malicious, mobile code. Because all of the popular web browsers execute code from multiple sources together in the same JVM,
many of the security guidelines for mobile code are focused on preventing manipulation of your objects' state and behavior by
adversaries who have access to the same virtual machine where your product is running.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
