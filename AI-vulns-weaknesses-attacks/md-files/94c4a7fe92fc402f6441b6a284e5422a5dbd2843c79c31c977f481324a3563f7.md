CWE-103: Struts: Incomplete validate() Method Definition
Weakness ID: 103
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product has a validator form that either does not define a validate() method, or defines a validate() method but does not call
super .validate().
 Extended Description
If the code does not call super .validate(), the V alidation Framework cannot check the contents of the form against a validation form. In
other words, the validation framework will be disabled for the given form.

 Background Details
The Struts V alidator uses a form's validate() method to check the contents of the form properties against the constraints specified in
the associated validation form. That means the following classes have a validate() method that is part of the validation framework:
ValidatorForm, V alidatorActionForm, DynaV alidatorForm, and DynaV alidatorActionForm. If the code creates a class that extends one
of these classes, and if that class implements custom validation logic by overriding the validate() method, the code must call
super .validate() in the validate() implementation.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Other
Disabling the validation framework for a form exposes the product to numerous types of attacks.
Unchecked input is the root cause of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL
injection.
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability
OtherTechnical Impact: Other
Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE
application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may
be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buf fer overflow attack.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example the class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user input data
from a registration webpage for an online business site. The user will enter registration data and the RegistrationForm bean in the
Struts framework will maintain the user data. Tthe RegistrationForm class implements the validate method to validate the user input
entered into the form.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/103.html 2/3Although the validate method is implemented in this example the method does not call the validate method of the V alidatorForm
parent class with a call super .validate(). Without the call to the parent validator class only the custom validation will be performed and
the default validation will not be performed. The following example shows that the validate method of the V alidatorForm class is called
within the implementation of the validate method.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Implement the validate() method and call super .validate() within that method.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
This could introduce other weaknesses related to missing input validation.
Maintenance
The current description implies a loose composite of two separate weaknesses, so this node might need to be split or converted into
a low-level category .
