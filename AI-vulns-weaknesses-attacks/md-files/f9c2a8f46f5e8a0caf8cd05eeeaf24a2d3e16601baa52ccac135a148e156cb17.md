CWE-628: Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
Weakness ID: 628
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine with arguments that are not correctly specified, leading to always-incorrect
behavior and resultant weaknesses.
 Extended Description
There are multiple ways in which this weakness can be introduced, including:
the wrong variable or reference;
an incorrect number of arguments;
incorrect order of arguments;
wrong type of arguments; or
wrong value.

This weakness can cause unintended behavior and can lead to additional weaknesses such as
allowing an attacker to gain unintended access to system resources.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/628.html 2/3Example 2
This Perl code intends to record whether a user authenticated successfully or not, and to exit if the user fails to authenticate.
However , when it calls ReportAuth(), the third argument is specified as 0 instead of 1, so it does not exit.
Example 3
In the following Java snippet, the accessGranted() method is accidentally called with the static ADMIN\_ROLES array rather than the
user roles.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2006-7049 The method calls the functions with the wrong argument order , which allows remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Build and Compilation
Once found, these issues are easy to fix. Use code inspection tools and relevant compiler features to identify potential violations.
Pay special attention to code that is not likely to be exercised heavily during QA.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Make sure your API's are stable before you use them in production code.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
This is usually primary to other weaknesses, but it can be resultant if the function's API or function prototype
changes.
 Detection Methods
Other
Since these bugs typically introduce incorrect behavior that is obvious to users, they are found quickly , unless they occur in
rarely-tested code paths. Managing the correct number of arguments can be made more dif ficult in cases where format strings
are used, or when variable numbers of arguments are supported.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
