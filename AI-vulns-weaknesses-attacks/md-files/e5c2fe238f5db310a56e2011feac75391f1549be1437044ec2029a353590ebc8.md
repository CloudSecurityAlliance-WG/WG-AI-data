View customized information:
 Description
A function or method contains too many operations that utilize a data manager or file resource.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-consuming
to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
While the interpretation of "too many operations" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ recommends a default maximum of 7
operations for the same data manager or file.
