CWE-1122: Excessive Halstead Complexity
Weakness ID: 1122
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code is structured in a way that a Halstead complexity measure exceeds a desirable maximum.
 Extended Description
A variety of Halstead complexity measures exist, such as program vocabulary size or volume.
This issue makes it more dif ficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult
or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
Comments:
Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.
