View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of internal dot ('file.ordir') without appropriate validation, which can lead to ambiguous path
resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.
 Relationships

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
An improper attempt to remove the internal dots from the string could lead to CWE-181 (Incorrect Behavior Order: V alidate Before
Filter).
