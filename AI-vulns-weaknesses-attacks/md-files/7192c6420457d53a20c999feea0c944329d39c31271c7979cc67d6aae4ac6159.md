CWE-595: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents
Weakness ID: 595
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product compares object references instead of the contents of the objects themselves, preventing it from detecting equivalent
objects.
 Extended Description
For example, in Java, comparing objects using == usually produces deceptive results, since the == operator compares object
references rather than values; often, this means that using == for strings is actually comparing the strings' references, not their values.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the example below , two Java String objects are declared and initialized with the same string values. An if statement is used to
determine if the strings are equivalent.
However , the if statement will not be executed as the strings are compared using the "==" operator . For Java objects, such as String
objects, the "==" operator compares object references, not object values. While the two String objects above contain the same string
values, they refer to dif ferent object references, so the System.out.println statement will not be executed. To compare object values,
the previous code could be modified to use the equals method:About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/595.html 2/3Example 2
In the following Java example, two BankAccount objects are compared in the isSameAccount method using the == operator .
Using the == operator to compare objects may produce incorrect or deceptive results by comparing object references rather than
values. The equals() method should be used to ensure correct results or objects should contain a member variable that uniquely
identifies the object.
The following example shows the use of the equals() method to compare the BankAccount objects and the next example uses a class
get method to retrieve the bank account number that uniquely identifies the BankAccount object to compare the objects.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
In Java, use the equals() method to compare objects instead of the == operator . If using ==, it is important for performance
reasons that your objects are created by a static factory , not by a constructor .
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
