CWE-925: Improper V erification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver

View customized information:
 Description
The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an
authorized source.
 Extended Description
Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party
applications. However , when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any
explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target
application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another
application. This may lead to unintended behavior .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/925.html 2/3The ShutdownReceiver class will handle the intent:
Because the method does not confirm that the intent action is the expected system intent, any received intent will trigger the
shutdown procedure, as shown here:
An attacker can use this behavior to cause a denial of service.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Before acting on the Intent, check the Intent Action to make sure it matches the expected System action.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.
