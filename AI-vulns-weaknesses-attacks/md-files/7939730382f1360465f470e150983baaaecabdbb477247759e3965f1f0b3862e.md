View customized information:
 Description
The product contains a clone() method that does not call super .clone() to obtain the new object.
 Extended Description
All implementations of clone() should obtain the new object by calling super .clone(). If a class does not follow this convention, a
subclass's clone() method will return an object of the wrong type.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following two classes demonstrate a bug introduced by not calling super .clone(). Because of the way Kibitzer implements clone(),
FancyKibitzer's clone method will return an object of type Kibitzer instead of FancyKibitzer .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/580.html 2/2Phase: Implementation
Call super .clone() within your clone() method, when obtaining a new object.
Phase: Implementation
In some cases, you can eliminate the clone method altogether and use copy constructors.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
