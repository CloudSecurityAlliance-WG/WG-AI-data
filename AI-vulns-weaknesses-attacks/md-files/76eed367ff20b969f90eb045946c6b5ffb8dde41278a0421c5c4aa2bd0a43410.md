 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following example, an XSS neutralization method intends to replace script tags in user-supplied input with a safe equivalent:
The code only works when the "script" tag is in all lower-case, forming an incomplete denylist ( CWE-184 ). Equivalent tags such as
"SCRIPT" or "ScRiPt" will not be neutralized by this method, allowing an XSS attack.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-0738 XSS using "&={script}".
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Resolve all input to absolute or canonical representations before processing.
Phase: Implementation
Carefully check each input parameter against a rigorous positive specification (allowlist) defining the specific characters and
format allowed. All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify , but all data in the
request, including tag attributes, hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to
continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. W e often encounter data
from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also,
a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer . Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is
recommended.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

Strategy: Output Encoding
Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common
encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a
different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be
erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as
special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct
injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being
used by the downstream component.
The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header , web
browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.
Phase: Implementation
With Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction
To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly . In browsers that support
the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session
cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since
HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly , XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies
provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
