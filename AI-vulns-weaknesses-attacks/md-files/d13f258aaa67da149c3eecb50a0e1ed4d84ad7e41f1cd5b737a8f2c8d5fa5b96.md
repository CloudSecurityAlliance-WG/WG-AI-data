The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as chroot() should be dropped immediately after the operation is
performed.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access Control
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity; Read Application Data; Read Files or Directories
An attacker may be able to access resources with the elevated privilege that could not be accessed
with the attacker's original privileges. This is particularly likely in conjunction with another flaw , such
as a buf fer overflow .

The following code calls chroot() to restrict the application to a subset of the filesystem below APP\_HOME in order to prevent an
attacker from using the program to gain unauthorized access to files located elsewhere. The code then opens a file specified by the
user and processes the contents of the file.
Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However ,
the absence of a call to setuid() with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary root
privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack
because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser . If the application drops to the privilege level
of a non-root user , the potential for damage is substantially reduced.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation
Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive
data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.
Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and
reinforces privilege separation functionality . Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the
appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Compare binary / bytecode to application permission manifest
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Host-based V ulnerability Scanners - Examine configuration for flaws, verifying that audit mechanisms work, ensure
host configuration meets certain predefined criteria
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Other
If system privileges are not dropped when it is reasonable to do so, this is not a vulnerability by itself. According to the principle of
least privilege, access should be allowed only when it is absolutely necessary to the function of a given system, and only for the
minimal necessary amount of time. Any further allowance of privilege widens the window of time during which a successful
exploitation of the system will provide an attacker with that same privilege. If at all possible, limit the allowance of system privilege to
small, simple sections of code that may be called atomically .
When a program calls a privileged function, such as chroot(), it must first acquire root privilege. As soon as the privileged operation
has completed, the program should drop root privilege and return to the privilege level of the invoking user .
Maintenance
CWE-271 , CWE-272 , and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a
category .
