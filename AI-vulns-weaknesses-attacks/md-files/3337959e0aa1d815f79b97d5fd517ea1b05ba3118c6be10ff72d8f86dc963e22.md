CWE-671: Lack of Administrator Control over Security
Weakness ID: 671
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses security features in a way that prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the
environment in which the product is being used. This introduces resultant weaknesses or prevents it from operating at a level of
security that is desired by the administrator .
 Extended Description
If the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product
from outside threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example, a hard-coded account name and
password cannot be changed by the administrator , thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/671.html 2/2Every instance of this program can be placed into diagnostic mode with the same password. Even worse is the fact that if this
program is distributed as a binary-only distribution, it is very dif ficult to change that password or disable this "functionality ."
