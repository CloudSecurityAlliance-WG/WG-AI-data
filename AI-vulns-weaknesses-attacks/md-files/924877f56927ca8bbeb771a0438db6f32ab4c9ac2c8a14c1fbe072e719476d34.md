}3/7/24, 2:57 PM CWE - CWE-346: Origin Validation Error (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/346.html 2/4This application does not check the origin of the intent, thus allowing any malicious application to remove a user . Always check the
origin of an intent, or create an allowlist of trusted applications using the manifest.xml file.
Example 2
These Android and iOS applications intercept URL loading within a W ebView and perform special actions if a particular URL scheme
is used, thus allowing the Javascript within the W ebView to communicate with the application:
A call into native code can then be initiated by passing parameters within the URL:
Because the application does not check the source, a malicious website loaded within this W ebView has the same access to the API
as a trusted site.

 Notes
Terminology
The "Origin V alidation Error" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [ REF-324 ]. Although not formally defined, an issue is
considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system
[fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system
(1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only
example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without
dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) ef fectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287
(Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There
appears to be little usage of this term today , except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety
of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an
incoming message.
Maintenance
This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.
