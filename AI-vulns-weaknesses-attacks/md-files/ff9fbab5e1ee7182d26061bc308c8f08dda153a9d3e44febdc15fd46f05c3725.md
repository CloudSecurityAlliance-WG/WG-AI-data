Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
 Extended Description
There are many dif ferent kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely ,
depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may
provide to an attacker . Some kinds of sensitive information include:
private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact
details
system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages
business secrets and intellectual property
network status and configuration
the product's own code or internal state
metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers
indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider
Information might be sensitive to dif ferent parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should
be protected. These parties include:
the product's own users
people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users
the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates
the developer
Information exposures can occur in dif ferent ways:
the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to
unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"
a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error
revealing the full system path of the program.
the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made
accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a dif ferent weakness enabled the
access to the information in the first place.
It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in
CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of dif ferent
weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to
cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer , or cleanse sensitive information.
 Alternate T erms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact,
for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality . Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent
the loss of confidentiality , even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the
mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory
contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory . In
addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to
any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security . In some
cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a dif ferent weakness, but in other
cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to
exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code checks validity of the supplied username and password and notifies the user of a successful or failed login.
In the above code, there are dif ferent messages for when an incorrect username is supplied, versus when the username is correct but
the password is wrong. This dif ference enables a potential attacker to understand the state of the login function, and could allow an
attacker to discover a valid username by trying dif ferent values until the incorrect password message is returned. In essence, this
makes it easier for an attacker to obtain half of the necessary authentication credentials.
While this type of information may be helpful to a user , it is also useful to a potential attacker . In the above example, the message for
both failed cases should be the same, such as:
(bad code) Example Language: Perl 
my $username=param('username');
my $password=param('password');
if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
{
if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
{
print "Login Successful";
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
}
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
(result) 
"Login Failed - incorrect username or password"3/7/24, 2:52 PM CWE - CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/200.html 3/7Example 2
This code tries to open a database connection, and prints any exceptions that occur .
If an exception occurs, the printed message exposes the location of the configuration file the script is using. An attacker can use this
information to target the configuration file (perhaps exploiting a Path Traversal weakness). If the file can be read, the attacker could
gain credentials for accessing the database. The attacker may also be able to replace the file with a malicious one, causing the
application to use an arbitrary database.
Example 3
In the example below , the method getUserBankAccount retrieves a bank account object from a database using the supplied
username and account number to query the database. If an SQLException is raised when querying the database, an error message is
created and output to a log file.
The error message that is created includes information about the database query that may contain sensitive information about the
database or query logic. In this case, the error message will expose the table name and column names used in the database. This
data could be used to simplify other attacks, such as SQL injection ( CWE-89 ) to directly access the database.
Example 4
This code stores location information about the current user:
When the application encounters an exception it will write the user object to the log. Because the user object contains location
information, the user's location is also written to the log.
Example 5
The following is an actual MySQL error statement:(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
try {
openDbConnection();
}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {
echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';
echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql\_config\_location, '\n';
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public BankAccount getUserBankAccount(String username, String accountNumber) {
BankAccount userAccount = null;
String query = null;
try {
if (isAuthorizedUser(username)) {
query = "SELECT \* FROM accounts WHERE owner = "
+ username + " AND accountID = " + accountNumber;
DatabaseManager dbManager = new DatabaseManager();
Connection conn = dbManager.getConnection();
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet queryResult = stmt.executeQuery(query);
userAccount = (BankAccount)queryResult.getObject(accountNumber);
}
} catch (SQLException ex) {
String logMessage = "Unable to retrieve account information from database,\nquery: " + query;
Logger.getLogger(BankManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, logMessage, ex);
}
return userAccount;
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);
locationClient.connect();
currentUser.setLocation(locationClient.getLastLocation());
...
catch (Exception e) {
AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
builder.setMessage("Sorry, this application has experienced an error.");
AlertDialog alert = builder.create();
alert.show();
Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Caught exception: " + e + " While on User:" + User.toString());
}
(result) Example Language: SQL 
Warning: mysql\_pconnect(): Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: N1nj4) in /usr/local/www/wi-

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/200.html 4/7The error clearly exposes the database credentials.
Example 6
This code displays some information on a web page.
The code displays a user's credit card and social security numbers, even though they aren't absolutely necessary .
Example 7
The following program changes its behavior based on a debug flag.
The code writes sensitive debug information to the client browser if the "debugEnabled" flag is set to true .
Example 8
This code uses location to determine the user's current US State location.
First the application must declare that it requires the ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCA TION permission in the application's manifest.xml:
During execution, a call to getLastLocation() will return a location based on the application's location permissions. In this case the
application has permission for the most accurate location possible:
While the application needs this information, it does not need to use the ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCA TION permission, as the
ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCA TION permission will be suf ficient to identify which US state the user is in.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive
data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.
Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and
reinforces privilege separation functionality . Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the
appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Developers may insert sensitive information that they do not believe, or they might forget to remove the sensitive
information after it has been processed
Resultant(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Separate mistakes or weaknesses could inadvertently make the sensitive information available to an attacker , such
as in a detailed error message that can be read by an unauthorized party

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Frequent Misuse
Rationale:
CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability , but confidentiality loss is a technical
impact - not a root cause error . As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality . Other options are often
available. [ REF-1287 ].
Comments:
If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error . Consider starting with improper
authorization ( CWE-285 ), insecure permissions ( CWE-732 ), improper authentication ( CWE-287 ), etc. Also consider children such
as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data ( CWE-201 ), Observable Discrepancy ( CWE-203 ), Insertion of Sensitive
Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory ( CWE-538 ), or others.
 Notes
Maintenance
As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review , since it is frequently
misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality . See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and
Alternate Terms.
