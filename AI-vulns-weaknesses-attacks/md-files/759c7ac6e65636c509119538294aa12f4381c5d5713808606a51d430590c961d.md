CWE-539: Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information
Weakness ID: 539
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The web application uses persistent cookies, but the cookies contain sensitive information.
 Extended Description
Cookies are small bits of data that are sent by the web application but stored locally in the browser . This lets the application use the
cookie to pass information between pages and store variable information. The web application controls what information is stored in a
cookie and how it is used. Typical types of information stored in cookies are session identifiers, personalization and customization
information, and in rare cases even usernames to enable automated logins. There are two dif ferent types of cookies: session cookies
and persistent cookies. Session cookies just live in the browser's memory and are not stored anywhere, but persistent cookies are
stored on the browser's hard drive. This can cause security and privacy issues depending on the information stored in the cookie and
how it is accessed.

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/539.html 2/2Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
