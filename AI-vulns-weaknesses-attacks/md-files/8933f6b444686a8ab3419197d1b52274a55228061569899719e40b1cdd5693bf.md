CWE-585: Empty Synchronized Block
Weakness ID: 585
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains an empty synchronized block.
 Extended Description
An empty synchronized block does not actually accomplish any synchronization and may indicate a troubled section of code. An
empty synchronized block can occur because code no longer needed within the synchronized block is commented out without
removing the synchronized block.

Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Other
An empty synchronized block will wait until nobody else is using the synchronizer being specified. While this
may be part of the desired behavior , because you haven't protected the subsequent code by placing it inside
the synchronized block, nothing is stopping somebody else from modifying whatever it was you were waiting
for while you run the subsequent code.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code attempts to synchronize on an object, but does not execute anything in the synchronized block. This does not
actually accomplish anything and may be a sign that a programmer is wrestling with synchronization but has not yet achieved the
result they intend.
Instead, in a correct usage, the synchronized statement should contain procedures that access or modify data that is exposed to
multiple threads. For example, consider a scenario in which several threads are accessing student records at the same time. The
method which sets the student ID to a new value will need to make sure that nobody else is accessing this data at the same time and
will require synchronization.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
When you come across an empty synchronized statement, or a synchronized statement in which the code has been commented
out, try to determine what the original intentions were and whether or not the synchronized block is still necessary .
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
