 Description
The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from
another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.

 Background Details
A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor , or a group of actors. A product's security
model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly . For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who
can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can
create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on
which the product is installed." Each sphere has dif ferent sets of actors and allowable behaviors.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code demonstrates the unrestricted upload of a file with a Java servlet and a path traversal vulnerability . The action
attribute of an HTML form is sending the upload file request to the Java servlet.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

3/7/24, 3:07 PM CWE - CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/669.html 2/4When submitted the Java servlet's doPost method will receive the request, extract the name of the file from the Http request header ,
read the file contents from the request and output the file to the local upload directory .
This code does not perform a check on the type of the file being uploaded ( CWE-434 ). This could allow an attacker to upload any
executable file or other file with malicious code.
Additionally , the creation of the Buf feredW riter object is subject to relative path traversal ( CWE-23 ). Since the code does not check the
filename that is provided in the header , an attacker can use "../" sequences to write to files outside of the intended directory .
Depending on the executing environment, the attacker may be able to specify arbitrary files to write to, leading to a wide variety of
consequences, from code execution, XSS ( CWE-79 ), or system crash.
Example 2
This code includes an external script to get database credentials, then authenticates a user against the database, allowing access to
the application.(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
...
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
String contentType = request.getContentType();
// the starting position of the boundary header
int ind = contentType.indexOf("boundary=");
String boundary = contentType.substring(ind+9);
String pLine = new String();
String uploadLocation = new String(UPLOAD\_DIRECTORY\_STRING); //Constant value
// verify that content type is multipart form data
if (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf("multipart/form-data") != -1) {
// extract the filename from the Http header
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));
...
pLine = br.readLine();
String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));
...
// output the file to the local upload directory
try {
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));
for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {
if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {
bw.write(line);
bw.newLine();
bw.flush();
}
} //end of for loop
bw.close();
} catch (IOException ex) {...}
// output successful upload response HTML page
}
// output unsuccessful upload response HTML page
else
{...}
}
...
}
(bad code) Example Language: PHP 
//assume the password is already encrypted, avoiding CWE-312
function authenticate($username,$password){
include("http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php");
//dbInfo.php makes $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname available
mysql\_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');
mysql\_select\_db($dbname);
$query = 'Select \* from users where username='.$username.' And password='.$password;
$result = mysql\_query($query);
if(mysql\_numrows($result) == 1){
mysql\_close();
return true;
}3/7/24, 3:07 PM CWE - CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/669.html 3/4This code does not verify that the external domain accessed is the intended one. An attacker may somehow cause the external
domain name to resolve to an attack server , which would provide the information for a false database. The attacker may then steal the
usernames and encrypted passwords from real user login attempts, or simply allow themself to access the application without a real
user account.
This example is also vulnerable to an Adversary-in-the-Middle AITM ( CWE-300 ) attack.
Example 3
This code either generates a public HTML user information page or a JSON response containing the same user information.
The programmer is careful to not display the user's e-mail address when displaying the public HTML page. However , the e-mail
address is not removed from the JSON response, exposing the user's e-mail address.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-22909 Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate
validation ( CWE-295 ), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware
image ( CWE-494 ).
CVE-2023-5227 PHP-based F AQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
CVE-2005-0406 Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within
the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
