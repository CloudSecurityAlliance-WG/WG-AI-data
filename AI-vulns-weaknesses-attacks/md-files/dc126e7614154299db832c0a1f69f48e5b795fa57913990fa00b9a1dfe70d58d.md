 Description
Authenticating a user , or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an
attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.

Requires 441 Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')
 Extended Description
Such a scenario is commonly observed when:
A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session, thereby continuing to use the session
already associated with the user .
An attacker is able to force a known session identifier on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access
to the authenticated session.
The application or container uses predictable session identifiers. In the generic exploit of session fixation vulnerabilities, an
attacker creates a new session on a web application and records the associated session identifier . The attacker then causes
the victim to associate, and possibly authenticate, against the server using that session identifier , giving the attacker access
to the user's account through the active session.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/384.html 2/3In order to exploit the code above, an attacker could first create a session (perhaps by logging into the application) from a public
terminal, record the session identifier assigned by the application, and reset the browser to the login page. Next, a victim sits down at
the same public terminal, notices the browser open to the login page of the site, and enters credentials to authenticate against the
application. The code responsible for authenticating the victim continues to use the pre-existing session identifier , now the attacker
simply uses the session identifier recorded earlier to access the victim's active session, providing nearly unrestricted access to the
victim's account for the lifetime of the session. Even given a vulnerable application, the success of the specific attack described here
is dependent on several factors working in the favor of the attacker: access to an unmonitored public terminal, the ability to keep the
compromised session active and a victim interested in logging into the vulnerable application on the public terminal.
In most circumstances, the first two challenges are surmountable given a suf ficient investment of time. Finding a victim who is both
using a public terminal and interested in logging into the vulnerable application is possible as well, so long as the site is reasonably
popular . The less well known the site is, the lower the odds of an interested victim using the public terminal and the lower the chance
of success for the attack vector described above. The biggest challenge an attacker faces in exploiting session fixation vulnerabilities
is inducing victims to authenticate against the vulnerable application using a session identifier known to the attacker .
In the example above, the attacker did this through a direct method that is not subtle and does not scale suitably for attacks involving
less well-known web sites. However , do not be lulled into complacency; attackers have many tools in their belts that help bypass the
limitations of this attack vector . The most common technique employed by attackers involves taking advantage of cross-site scripting
or HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities in the target site [12]. By tricking the victim into submitting a malicious request to a
vulnerable application that reflects JavaScript or other code back to the victim's browser , an attacker can create a cookie that will
cause the victim to reuse a session identifier controlled by the attacker . It is worth noting that cookies are often tied to the top level
domain associated with a given URL. If multiple applications reside on the same top level domain, such as bank.example.com and
recipes.example.com, a vulnerability in one application can allow an attacker to set a cookie with a fixed session identifier that will be
used in all interactions with any application on the domain example.com [29].
Example 2
The following example shows a snippet of code from a J2EE web application where the application authenticates users with a direct
post to the `j_security_check`, which typically does not invalidate the existing session before processing the login
request.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-2820 Website software for game servers does not proprerly terminate user sessions, allowing for possible
session fixation
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Invalidate any existing session identifiers prior to authorizing a new user session.
Phase: Architecture and Design
For platforms such as ASP that do not generate new values for sessionid cookies, utilize a secondary cookie. In this approach,
set a secondary cookie on the user's browser to a random value and set a session variable to the same value. If the session
variable and the cookie value ever don't match, invalidate the session, and force the user to log on again.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/384.html 3/3Comments:
While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future
research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which
weaknesses allow session fixation to occur , and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable session identifiers might
enable session fixation attacks to succeed; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability
weaknesses.
 Notes
Other
Other attack vectors include DNS poisoning and related network based attacks where an attacker causes the user to visit a
malicious site by redirecting a request for a valid site. Network based attacks typically involve a physical presence on the victim's
network or control of a compromised machine on the network, which makes them harder to exploit remotely , but their significance
should not be overlooked. Less secure session management mechanisms, such as the default implementation in Apache Tomcat,
allow session identifiers normally expected in a cookie to be specified on the URL as well, which enables an attacker to cause a
victim to use a fixed session identifier simply by emailing a malicious URL.
