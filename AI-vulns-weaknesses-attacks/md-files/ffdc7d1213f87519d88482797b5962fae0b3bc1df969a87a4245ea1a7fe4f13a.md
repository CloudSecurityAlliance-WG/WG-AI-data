CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
Weakness ID: 617
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker , which leads to an application exit or other
behavior that is more severe than necessary .
 Extended Description
While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still
lead to a denial of service.
For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all
other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
An attacker that can trigger an assert statement can still lead to a denial of service if the relevant code
can be triggered by an attacker , and if the scope of the assert() extends beyond the attacker's own
session.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the excerpt below , an AssertionError (an unchecked exception) is thrown if the user hasn't entered an email address in an HTML
form.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Make sensitive open/close operation non reachable by directly user-controlled data (e.g. open/close resources)
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Perform input validation on user data.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Resultant(where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
