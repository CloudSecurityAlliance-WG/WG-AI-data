 Description
According to W ASC, "Insuf ficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or
session IDs for authorization."

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following snippet was taken from a J2EE web.xml deployment descriptor in which the session-timeout parameter is explicitly
defined (the default value depends on the container). In this case the value is set to -1, which means that a session will never expire.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Set sessions/credentials expiration date.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building aAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Other
The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a
session ID, possibly via a network snif fer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a
stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might
access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library , Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insuf ficient Session
Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.
