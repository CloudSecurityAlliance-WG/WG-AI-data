Weakness ID: 686
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies an argument that is the wrong data type, which may lead to
resultant weaknesses.
 Extended Description
This weakness is most likely to occur in loosely typed languages, or in strongly typed languages in which the types of variable
arguments cannot be enforced at compilation time, or where there is implicit casting.

Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the
product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the
incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected
argument type.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/686.html 2/2Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
