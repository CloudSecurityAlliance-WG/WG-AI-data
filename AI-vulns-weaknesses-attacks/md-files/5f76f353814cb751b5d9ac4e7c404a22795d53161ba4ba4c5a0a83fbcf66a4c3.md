CWE-446: UI Discrepancy for Security Feature
Weakness ID: 446
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The user interface does not correctly enable or configure a security feature, but the interface provides feedback that causes the user
to believe that the feature is in a secure state.
 Extended Description
When the user interface does not properly reflect what the user asks of it, then it can lead the user into a false sense of security . For
example, the user might check a box to enable a security option to enable encrypted communications, but the product does not
actually enable the encryption. Alternately , the user might provide a "restrict ALL" access control rule, but the product only implements
"restrict SOME".
