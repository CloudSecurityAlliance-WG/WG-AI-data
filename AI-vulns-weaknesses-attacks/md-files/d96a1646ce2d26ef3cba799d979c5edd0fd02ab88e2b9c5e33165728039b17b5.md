It is possible to overflow the number of temporary files because directories typically have limits on
the number of files allowed. This could create a denial of service problem.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Stream resources in a Java application should be released in a finally block, otherwise an exception thrown before the call to close()
would result in an unreleased I/O resource. In the example below , the close() method is called in the try block (incorrect).

 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Temporary files and other supporting resources should be deleted/released immediately after they are no longer needed.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-
459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for "proper" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That
is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.
Relationship
Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g.
leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).
