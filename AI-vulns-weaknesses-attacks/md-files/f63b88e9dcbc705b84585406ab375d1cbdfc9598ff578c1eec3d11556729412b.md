CWE-607: Public Static Final Field References Mutable Object
Weakness ID: 607
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A public or protected static final field references a mutable object, which allows the object to be changed by malicious code, or
accidentally from another package.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Here, an array (which is inherently mutable) is labeled public static final.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Protect mutable objects by making them private. Restrict access to the getter and setter as well.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/607.html 2/2Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
