CWE-1266: Improper Scrubbing of Sensitive Data from Decommissioned Device

View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly provide a capability for the product administrator to remove sensitive data at the time the product is
decommissioned. A scrubbing capability could be missing, insuf ficient, or incorrect.
 Extended Description
When a product is decommissioned - i.e., taken out of service - best practices or regulatory requirements may require the
administrator to remove or overwrite sensitive data first, i.e. "scrubbing." Improper scrubbing of sensitive data from a decommissioned
device leaves that data vulnerable to acquisition by a malicious actor . Sensitive data may include, but is not limited to,
device/manufacturer proprietary information, user/device credentials, network configurations, and other forms of sensitive data.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Functionality to completely scrub data from a product at the conclusion of its lifecycle should be part of the design phase. Trying
to add this function on top of an existing architecture could lead to incomplete removal of sensitive information/data.
Phase: Policy
The manufacturer should describe the location(s) where sensitive data is stored and the policies and procedures for its removal.
This information may be conveyed, for example, in an Administrators Guide or a Statement of V olatility .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1266.html 2/2If the capability to wipe sensitive data isn't built-in, the manufacturer may need to provide a utility to scrub sensitive data from
storage if that data is located in a place which is non-accessible by the administrator . One example of this could be when
sensitive data is stored on an EEPROM for which there is no user/admin interface provided by the system.

Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.
