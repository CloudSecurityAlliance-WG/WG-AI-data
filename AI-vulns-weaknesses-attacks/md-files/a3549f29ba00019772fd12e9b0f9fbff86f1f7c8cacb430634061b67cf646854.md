Cost Harvesting 󰅂
Summary
Adversaries may target dif ferent machine learning services to send useless queries
or computationally expensive inputs to increase the cost of running services at the
victim organization. Sponge examples are a particular type of adversarial data
designed to maximize energy consumption and thus operating cost.
