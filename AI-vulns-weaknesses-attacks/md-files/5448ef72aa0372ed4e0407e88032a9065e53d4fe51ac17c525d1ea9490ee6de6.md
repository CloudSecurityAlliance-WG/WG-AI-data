CWE-768: Incorrect Short Circuit Evaluation
Weakness ID: 768
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains a conditional statement with multiple logical expressions in which one of the non-leading expressions may
produce side ef fects. This may lead to an unexpected state in the program after the execution of the conditional, because short-
circuiting logic may prevent the side ef fects from occurring.
 Extended Description
Usage of short circuit evaluation, though well-defined in the C standard, may alter control flow in a way that introduces logic errors
that are dif ficult to detect, possibly causing errors later during the product's execution. If an attacker can discover such an
inconsistency , it may be exploitable to gain arbitrary control over a system.
If the first condition of an "or" statement is assumed to be true under normal circumstances, or if the first condition of an "and"
statement is assumed to be false, then any subsequent conditional may contain its own logic errors that are not detected during code
review or testing.
Finally , the usage of short circuit evaluation may decrease the maintainability of the code.

Widely varied consequences are possible if an attacker is aware of an unexpected state in the
product after a conditional. It may lead to information exposure, a system crash, or even complete
attacker control of the system.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following function attempts to take a size value from a user and allocate an array of that size (we ignore bounds checking for
simplicity). The function tries to initialize each spot with the value of its index, that is, A[len-1] = len - 1; A[len-2] = len - 2; ... A[1] = 1;
A[0] = 0; However , since the programmer uses the prefix decrement operator , when the conditional is evaluated with i == 1, the
decrement will result in a 0 value for the first part of the predicate, causing the second portion to be bypassed via short-circuit
evaluation. This means we cannot be sure of what value will be in A[0] when we return the array to the user .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/768.html 2/2When compiled and run, the above code will output a privilege level of 1, or PRIV\_REGULAR for every user but the user with id 0
since the prefix increment operator used in the if statement will reach zero and short circuit before setting the 0th user's privilege level.
Since we used calloc, this privilege will be set to 0, or PRIV\_ADMIN.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Minimizing the number of statements in a conditional that produce side ef fects will help to prevent the likelihood of short circuit
evaluation to alter control flow in an unexpected way .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
