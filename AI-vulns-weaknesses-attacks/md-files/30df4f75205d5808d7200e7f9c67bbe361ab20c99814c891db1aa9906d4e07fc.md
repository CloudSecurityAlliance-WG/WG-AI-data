CWE-572: Call to Thread run() instead of start()
Weakness ID: 572
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a thread's run() method instead of calling start(), which causes the code to run in the thread of the caller instead of
the callee.
 Extended Description
In most cases a direct call to a Thread object's run() method is a bug. The programmer intended to begin a new thread of control, but
accidentally called run() instead of start(), so the run() method will execute in the caller's thread of control.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Use the start() method instead of the run() method.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
