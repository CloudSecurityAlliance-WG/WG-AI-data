Summary󰅂 󰅂
󰅂
Research labs at academic institutions and Company R&D
divisions often have blogs that highlight their use of
machine learning and its application to the organizations
unique problems. Individual researchers also frequently
document their work in blogposts. An adversary may search
for posts made by the target victim organization or its
employees. In comparison to Journals and Conference
Proceedings and Pre-Print Repositories this material will
often contain more practical aspects of the machine
learning system. This could include underlying technologies
and frameworks used, and possibly some information
about the API access and use case. This will help the
adversary better understand how that organization is using
machine learning internally and the details of their
approach that could aid in tailoring an attack.ID: AML.T0000.002
