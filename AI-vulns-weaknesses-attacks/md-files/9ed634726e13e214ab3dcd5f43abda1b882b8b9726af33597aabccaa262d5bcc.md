CWE-687: Function Call W ith Incorrectly Specified Argument V alue
Weakness ID: 687
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies an argument that contains the wrong value, which may lead
to resultant weaknesses.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This Perl code intends to record whether a user authenticated successfully or not, and to exit if the user fails to authenticate.
However , when it calls ReportAuth(), the third argument is specified as 0 instead of 1, so it does not exit.

Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Manual Static Analysis
This might require an understanding of intended program behavior or design to determine whether the value is incorrect.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
When primary , this weakness is most likely to occur in rarely-tested code, since the wrong value can change the semantic meaning
of the program's execution and lead to obviously-incorrect behavior . It can also be resultant from issues in which the program
assigns the wrong value to a variable, and that variable is later used in a function call. In that sense, this issue could be argued as
having chaining relationships with many implementation errors in CWE.
