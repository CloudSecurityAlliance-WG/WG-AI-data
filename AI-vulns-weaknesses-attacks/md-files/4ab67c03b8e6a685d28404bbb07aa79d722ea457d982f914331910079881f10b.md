Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This function is part of a privileged program that takes input from users with potentially lower privileges.
This code does not confirm that the process to be killed is owned by the requesting user , thus allowing an attacker to kill arbitrary
processes.
This function remedies the problem by checking the owner of the process before killing it:

 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation
Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Notes
Maintenance
The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research
view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two dif ferent pillars, related to control of resources ( CWE-664 ) and protection
mechanism failures ( CWE-693 ).
