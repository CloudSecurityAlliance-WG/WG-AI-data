 Description
The product does not suf ficiently monitor or control transmitted network traf fic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to
transmit more traf fic than should be allowed for that actor .
 Extended Description
In the absence of a policy to restrict asymmetric resource consumption, the application or system cannot distinguish between
legitimate transmissions and traf fic intended to serve as an amplifying attack on target systems. Systems can often be configured to
restrict the amount of traf fic sent out on behalf of a client, based on the client's origin or access level. This is usually defined in a
resource allocation policy . In the absence of a mechanism to keep track of transmissions, the system or application can be easily
abused to transmit asymmetrically greater traf fic than the request or client should be permitted to.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Operation
Architecture and DesignIf the application uses UDP , then it could potentially be subject to spoofing attacks that use the inherent
weaknesses of UDP to perform traf fic amplification, although this problem can exist in other protocols or
contexts.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Amplification; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource
Consumption (Memory); DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)
System resources can be quickly consumed leading to poor application performance or system crash.
This may af fect network performance and could be used to attack other systems and applications relying
on network performance.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/406.html 2/2This code sends a DNS record to a requesting IP address. UDP allows the source IP address to be easily changed ('spoofed'), thus
allowing an attacker to redirect responses to a target, which may be then be overwhelmed by the network traf fic.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-1999-0513 Classic "Smurf" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.
CVE-1999-1379 DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traf fic to be returned to spoofed address than
was sent by the attacker .
CVE-2000-0041 Large datagrams are sent in response to malformed datagrams.
CVE-1999-1066 Game server sends a large amount.
CVE-2013-5211 composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source
addresses.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
An application must make network resources available to a client commensurate with the client's access level.
Phase: Policy
Define a clear policy for network resource allocation and consumption.
Phase: Implementation
An application must, at all times, keep track of network resources and meter their usage appropriately .

Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:

 Notes
Relationship
This can be resultant from weaknesses that simplify spoofing attacks.
Theoretical
Network amplification, when performed with spoofing, is normally a multi-channel attack from attacker (acting as user) to amplifier ,
and amplifier to victim.
