CWE-1230: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata
Weakness ID: 1230
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product prevents direct access to a resource containing sensitive information, but it does not suf ficiently limit access to metadata
that is derived from the original, sensitive information.
 Extended Description
Developers might correctly prevent unauthorized access to a database or other resource containing sensitive information, but they
might not consider that portions of the original information might also be recorded in metadata, search indices, statistical reports, or
other resources. If these resources are not also restricted, then attackers might be able to extract some or all of the original
information, or otherwise infer some details. For example, an attacker could specify search terms that are known to be unique to a
particular person, or view metadata such as activity or creation dates in order to identify usage patterns.

lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
