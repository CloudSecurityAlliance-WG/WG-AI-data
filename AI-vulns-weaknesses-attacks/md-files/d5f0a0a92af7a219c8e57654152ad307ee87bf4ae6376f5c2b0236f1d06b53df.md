Weakness ID: 541
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
If an include file source is accessible, the file can contain usernames and passwords, as well as sensitive information pertaining to the
application and system.
 Relationships

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code uses an include file to store database credentials:
database.inc
login.php
If the server does not have an explicit handler set for .inc files it may send the contents of database.inc to an attacker without pre-
processing, if the attacker requests the file directly . This will expose the database name and password.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Do not store sensitive information in include files.
Phases: Architecture and Design; System Configuration
Protect include files from being exposed.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
