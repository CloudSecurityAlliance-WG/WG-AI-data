 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Memory
Adjacent variables in memory may be corrupted by assignments performed on fields after the cast.
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
Execution may end due to a memory access error .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
