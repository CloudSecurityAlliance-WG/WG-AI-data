View customized information:
 Description
The product manages resources or behaves in a way that indirectly creates a new , distinct resource that can be used by attackers in
violation of the intended policy .
 Extended Description
A product is only expected to behave in a way that was specifically intended by the developer . Resource allocation and management
is expected to be performed explicitly by the associated code. However , in systems with complex behavior , the product might
indirectly produce new kinds of resources that were never intended in the original design. For example, a covert channel is a resource
that was never explicitly intended by the developer , but it is useful to attackers. "Parasitic computing," while not necessarily malicious
in nature, ef fectively tricks a product into performing unintended computations on behalf of another party .
