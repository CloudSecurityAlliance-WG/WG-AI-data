CWE-1083: Data Access from Outside Expected Data Manager Component
Weakness ID: 1083
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product is intended to manage data access through a particular data manager component such as a relational or non-SQL
database, but it contains code that performs data access operations without using that component.
 Extended Description
When the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all data access operations through that
component. If a data access operation is performed outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended
design.
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem
might introduce a vulnerability .
