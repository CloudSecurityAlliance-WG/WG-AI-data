CWE-797: Only Filtering Special Elements at an Absolute Position
Weakness ID: 797
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product receives data from an upstream component, but only accounts for special elements at an absolute position (e.g. "byte
number 10"), thereby missing remaining special elements that may exist before sending it to a downstream component.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code takes untrusted input and uses a substring function to filter a 3-character "../" element located at the 0-index
position of the input string. It then appends this result to the /home/user/ directory and attempts to read the file in the final resulting
path.
Since the if function is only looking for a substring of "../" between the 0 and 2 position, it only removes that specific "../" element. So
an input value such as:
will have the first "../" filtered, resulting in:
This value is then concatenated with the /home/user/ directory:About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {
$Username = substr($Username, 3);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/797.html 2/2which causes the /etc/passwd file to be retrieved once the operating system has resolved the ../ sequences in the pathname. This
leads to relative path traversal ( CWE-22 ).

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
