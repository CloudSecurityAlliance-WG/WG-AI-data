CWE-562: Return of Stack V ariable Address
Weakness ID: 562
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A function returns the address of a stack variable, which will cause unintended program behavior , typically in the form of a crash.
 Extended Description
Because local variables are allocated on the stack, when a program returns a pointer to a local variable, it is returning a stack
address. A subsequent function call is likely to re-use this same stack address, thereby overwriting the value of the pointer , which no
longer corresponds to the same variable since a function's stack frame is invalidated when it returns. At best this will cause the value
of the pointer to change unexpectedly . In many cases it causes the program to crash the next time the pointer is dereferenced.

ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Memory; Modify Memory; Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
If the returned stack buf fer address is dereferenced after the return, then an attacker may be able to
modify or read memory , depending on how the address is used. If the address is used for reading,
then the address itself may be exposed, or the contents that the address points to. If the address is
used for writing, this can lead to a crash and possibly code execution.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following function returns a stack address.

 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Fuzzing
Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
Effectiveness: High
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
