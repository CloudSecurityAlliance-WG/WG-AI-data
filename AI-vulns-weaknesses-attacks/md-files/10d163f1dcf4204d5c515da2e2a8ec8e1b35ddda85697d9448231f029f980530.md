 Description
In many cases, an attacker can leverage the conditions that cause unhandled exception errors in order to gain unauthorized access to
the system.

Example 1
In the following Java example the class InputFileRead enables an input file to be read using a FileReader object. In the constructor of
this class a default input file path is set to some directory on the local file system and the method setInputFile must be called to set the
name of the input file to be read in the default directory . The method readInputFile will create the FileReader object and will read the
contents of the file. If the method setInputFile is not called prior to calling the method readInputFile then the File object will remain null
when initializing the FileReader object. A Java RuntimeException will be raised, and an error message will be output to the user .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/537.html 2/3However , the error message output to the user contains information regarding the default directory on the local file system. This
information can be exploited and may lead to unauthorized access or use of the system. Any Java RuntimeExceptions that are
handled should not expose sensitive information to the user .
Example 2
In the example below , the BankManagerLoginServlet servlet class will process a login request to determine if a user is authorized to
use the BankManager W eb service. The doPost method will retrieve the username and password from the servlet request and will
determine if the user is authorized. If the user is authorized the servlet will go to the successful login page. Otherwise, the servlet will
raise a FailedLoginException and output the failed login message to the error page of the service.
However , the output message generated by the FailedLoginException includes the user-supplied password. Even if the password is
erroneous, it is probably close to the correct password. Since it is printed to the user's page, anybody who can see the screen display
will be able to see the password. Also, if the page is cached, the password might be written to disk.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Do not expose sensitive error information to the user .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
