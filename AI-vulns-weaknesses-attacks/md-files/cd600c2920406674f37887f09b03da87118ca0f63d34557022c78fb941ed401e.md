CWE-1271: Uninitialized V alue on Reset for Registers Holding Security Settings
Weakness ID: 1271
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
Security-critical logic is not set to a known value on reset.
 Extended Description
When the device is first brought out of reset, the state of registers will be indeterminate if they have not been initialized by the logic.
Before the registers are initialized, there will be a window during which the device is in an insecure state and may be vulnerable to
attack.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Shown below is a positive clock edge triggered flip-flop used to implement a lock bit for test and debug interface. When the circuit is
first brought out of reset, the state of the flip-flop will be unknown until the enable input and D-input signals update the flip-flop state.
In this example, an attacker can reset the device until the test and debug interface is unlocked and access the test interface until the
lock signal is driven to a known state by the logic.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1271.html 2/2The flip-flop can be set to a known value (0 or 1) on reset, but requires that the logic explicitly update the output of the flip-flop if the
reset signal is active.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Design checks should be performed to identify any uninitialized flip-flops used for security-critical functions.
Phase: Architecture and Design
All registers holding security-critical information should be set to a specific value on reset.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
