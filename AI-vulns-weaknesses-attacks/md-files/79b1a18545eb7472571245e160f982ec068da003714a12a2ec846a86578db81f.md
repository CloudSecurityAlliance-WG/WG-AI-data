CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool
Weakness ID: 410
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing
the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.
 Extended Description
Frequently the consequence is a "flood" of connection or sessions.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Availability
Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; Other
Floods often cause a crash or other problem besides denial of the resource itself; these are likely
examples of \*other\* vulnerabilities, not an insuf ficient resource pool.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following snippet from a Tomcat configuration file, a JDBC connection pool is defined with a maximum of 5 simultaneous
connections (with a 60 second timeout). In this case, it may be trivial for an attacker to instigate a denial of service (DoS) by using up
all of the available connections in the pool.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼
