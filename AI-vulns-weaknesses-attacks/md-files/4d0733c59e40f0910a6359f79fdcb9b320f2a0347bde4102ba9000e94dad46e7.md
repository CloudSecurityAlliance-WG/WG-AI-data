 Description
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the
algorithm.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
ImplementationDevelopers sometimes omit "expensive" (resource-intensive) steps in order to improve performance, especially
in devices with limited memory or slower CPUs. This step may be taken under a mistaken impression that the
step is unnecessary for the cryptographic algorithm.
Requirements This issue may happen when the requirements for the cryptographic algorithm are not clearly stated.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The example code is taken from the HMAC engine inside the buggy OpenPiton SoC of HACK@DAC'21 [ REF-1358 ]. HAMC is a
message authentication code (MAC) that uses both a hash and a secret crypto key . The HMAC engine in HACK@DAC SoC uses the
SHA-256 module for the calculation of the HMAC for 512 bits messages.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/325.html 2/3However , this HMAC engine cannot handle messages that are longer than 512 bits. Moreover , a complete HMAC will contain an
iterate hash function that breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a compression function (e.g.,
SHA-256). Therefore, the implementation of the HMAC in OpenPiton SoC is incomplete. Such HMAC engines will not be used in real-
world applications as the messages will usually be longer than 512 bits. For instance, OpenT itan of fers a comprehensive HMAC
implementation that utilizes a FIFO for temporarily storing the truncated message, as detailed in [ REF-1359 ].
To mitigate this, implement the iterative function to break up a message into blocks of a fixed size.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
