 Description
[PLANNED FOR DEPRECA TION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER CWE-252 , CWE-248 , OR CWE-1069 .] Ignoring

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code excerpt ignores a rarely-thrown exception from doExchange().
If a RareException were to ever be thrown, the program would continue to execute as though nothing unusual had occurred. The
program records no evidence indicating the special situation, potentially frustrating any later attempt to explain the program's
behavior .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/391.html 2/3The choice between a language which has named or unnamed exceptions needs to be done. While unnamed exceptions
exacerbate the chance of not properly dealing with an exception, named exceptions suf fer from the up call version of the weak
base class problem.
Phase: Requirements
A language can be used which requires, at compile time, to catch all serious exceptions. However , one must make sure to use
the most current version of the API as new exceptions could be added.
Phase: Implementation
Catch all relevant exceptions. This is the recommended solution. Ensure that all exceptions are handled in such a way that you
can be sure of the state of your system at any given moment.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reasons: Potential Deprecation, Frequent Misuse, Frequent Misinterpretation
Rationale:
This entry is slated for deprecation; it has multiple widespread interpretations by CWE analysts. It combines information from
three dif ferent taxonomies, but each taxonomy is talking about a slightly dif ferent issue.
Comments:
Consider CWE-252 , CWE-1069 , CWE-248 , or other entries under CWE-754 : Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional
Conditions or CWE-755 : Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions.
Suggestions:

CWE-1069 Empty Exception Block
CWE-248 Uncaught Exception
 Notes
Other
When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of two assumptions:
This method call can never fail.
It doesn't matter if this call fails.
Maintenance
This entry is slated for deprecation; it has multiple widespread interpretations by CWE analysts. It currently combines information
from three dif ferent taxonomies, but each taxonomy is talking about a slightly dif ferent issue. CWE analysts might map to this entry
based on any of these issues. 7PK has "Empty Catch Block" which has an association with empty exception block ( CWE-1069 ); in

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/391.html 3/3this case, the exception has performed the check, but does not handle. In PLOVER there is "Unchecked Return V alue" which is
CWE-252 , but unlike "Empty Catch Block" there isn't even a check of the issue - and "Unchecked Error Condition" implies lack of a
check. For CLASP , "Uncaught Exception" ( CWE-248 ) is associated with incorrect error propagation - uncovered in CWE 3.2 and
earlier , at least. There are other issues related to error handling and checks.
