CWE-1304: Improperly Preserved Integrity of Hardware Configuration State During
a Power Save/Restore Operation
Weakness ID: 1304
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs a power save/restore operation, but it does not ensure that the integrity of the configuration state is maintained
and/or verified between the beginning and ending of the operation.
 Extended Description
Before powering down, the Intellectual Property (IP) saves current state (S) to persistent storage such as flash or always-on memory
in order to optimize the restore operation. During this process, an attacker with access to the persistent storage may alter (S) to a
configuration that could potentially modify privileges, disable protections, and/or cause damage to the hardware. If the IP does not
validate the configuration state stored in persistent memory , upon regaining power or becoming operational again, the IP could be
compromised through the activation of an unwanted/harmful configuration.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1304.html 2/3The following pseudo-code is the proper workflow for the integrity checking mitigation:
It must be noted that in the previous example of good pseudo code, the memory (where the hash of the config state is stored) must
be trustworthy while the hardware is between the power save and restore states.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Inside the IP , incorporate integrity checking on the configuration state via a cryptographic hash. The hash can be protected
inside the IP such as by storing it in internal registers which never lose power . Before powering down, the IP performs a hash of
the configuration and saves it in these persistent registers. Upon restore, the IP performs a hash of the saved configuration and
compares it with the saved hash. If they do not match, then the IP should not trust the configuration.
Phase: Integration
Outside the IP , incorporate integrity checking of the configuration state via a trusted agent. Before powering down, the trusted
agent performs a hash of the configuration and saves the hash in persistent storage. Upon restore, the IP requests the trusted
agent validate its current configuration. If the configuration hash is invalid, then the IP should not trust the configuration.
Phase: Integration
Outside the IP , incorporate a protected environment that prevents undetected modification of the configuration state by untrusted
agents. Before powering down, a trusted agent saves the IP's configuration state in this protected location that only it is
privileged to. Upon restore, the trusted agent loads the saved state into the IP .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
