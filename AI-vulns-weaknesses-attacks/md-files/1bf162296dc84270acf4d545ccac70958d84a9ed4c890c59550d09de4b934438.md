CWE-180: Incorrect Behavior Order: V alidate Before Canonicalize
Weakness ID: 180
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product validates input before it is canonicalized, which prevents the product from detecting data that becomes invalid after the
canonicalization step.
 Extended Description
This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be
prevented, such as injection.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code attempts to validate a given input path by checking it against an allowlist and then return the canonical path. In this
specific case, the path is considered valid if it starts with the string "/safe\_dir/".
The problem with the above code is that the validation step occurs before canonicalization occurs. An attacker could provide an input
path of "/safe\_dir/../" that would pass the validation step. However , the canonicalization process sees the double dot as a traversal to
the parent directory and hence when canonicized the path would become just "/".
To avoid this problem, validation should occur after canonicalization takes place. In this case canonicalization occurs during the
initialization of the File object. The code below fixes the issue.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-0433 Product allows remote attackers to view restricted files via an HTTP request containing a "\*" (wildcard
or asterisk) character .
CVE-2003-0332 Product modifies the first two letters of a filename extension after performing a security check, which
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a filename with a .ats extension instead of a .hts
extension.
CVE-2002-0802 Database consumes an extra character when processing a character that cannot be converted, which
could remove an escape character from the query and make the application subject to SQL injection
attacks.
CVE-2000-0191 Overlaps "fakechild/../realchild"
CVE-2004-2363 Product checks URI for "<" and other literal characters, but does it before hex decoding the URI, so
"%3E" and other sequences are allowed.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated ( CWE-
180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice ( CWE-174 ). Such errors could be used to bypass
allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
