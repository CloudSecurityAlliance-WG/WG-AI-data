 Description
Using realloc() to resize buf fers that store sensitive information can leave the sensitive information exposed to attack, because it is not
removed from memory .
 Extended Description
When sensitive data such as a password or an encryption key is not removed from memory , it could be exposed to an attacker using
a "heap inspection" attack that reads the sensitive data using memory dumps or other methods. The realloc() function is commonly
used to increase the size of a block of allocated memory . This operation often requires copying the contents of the old memory block
into a new and larger block. This operation leaves the contents of the original block intact but inaccessible to the program, preventing
the program from being able to scrub sensitive data from memory . If an attacker can later examine the contents of a memory dump,
the sensitive data could be exposed.

OtherTechnical Impact: Read Memory; Other
Be careful using vfork() and fork() in security sensitive code. The process state will not be cleaned up
and will contain traces of data from past use.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code calls realloc() on a buf fer containing sensitive data:
There is an attempt to scrub the sensitive data from memory , but realloc() is used, so it could return a pointer to a dif ferent part of
memory . The memory that was originally allocated for cleartext\_buf fer could still contain an uncleared copy of the data.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
