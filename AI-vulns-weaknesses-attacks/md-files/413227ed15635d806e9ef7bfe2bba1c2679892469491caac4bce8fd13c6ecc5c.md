CWE-1050: Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop
Weakness ID: 1050
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product has a loop body or loop condition that contains a control element that directly or indirectly consumes platform resources,
e.g. messaging, sessions, locks, or file descriptors.
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly . If an attacker can influence the number of iterations in the loop, then this
performance problem might allow a denial of service by consuming more platform resources than intended.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
