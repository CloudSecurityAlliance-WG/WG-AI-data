View customized information:
 Description
The product collects personally identifiable information about a human user or the user's activities, but the product accesses this
information using other resources besides itself, and it does not require that user's explicit approval or direct input into the product.
 Extended Description
"Spyware" is a commonly used term with many definitions and interpretations. In general, it is meant to refer to products that collect
information or install functionality that human users might not allow if they were fully aware of the actions being taken by the software.
For example, a user might expect that tax software would collect a social security number and include it when filing a tax return, but
that same user would not expect gaming software to obtain the social security number from that tax software's data.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼
