CWE-1071: Empty Code Block
Weakness ID: 1071
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The source code contains a block that does not contain any code, i.e., the block is empty .
 Extended Description
Empty code blocks can occur in the bodies of conditionals, function or method definitions, exception handlers, etc. While an empty
code block might be intentional, it might also indicate incomplete implementation, accidental code deletion, unexpected macro
expansion, etc. For some programming languages and constructs, an empty block might be allowed by the syntax, but the lack of any
behavior within the block might violate a convention or API in such a way that it is an error .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example, the code catches an ArithmeticException.
Since the exception block is empty , no action is taken.
In the code below the exception has been logged and the bad execution has been handled in the desired way allowing the program to
continue in an expected way .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1071.html 2/2Example 2
The following code attempts to synchronize on an object, but does not execute anything in the synchronized block. This does not
actually accomplish anything and may be a sign that a programmer is wrestling with synchronization but has not yet achieved the
result they intend.
Instead, in a correct usage, the synchronized statement should contain procedures that access or modify data that is exposed to
multiple threads. For example, consider a scenario in which several threads are accessing student records at the same time. The
method which sets the student ID to a new value will need to make sure that nobody else is accessing this data at the same time and
will require synchronization.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
