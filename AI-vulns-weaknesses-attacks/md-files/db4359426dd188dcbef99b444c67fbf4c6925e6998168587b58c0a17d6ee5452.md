CWE-1074: Class with Excessively Deep Inheritance
Weakness ID: 1074
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A class has an inheritance level that is too high, i.e., it has a large number of parent classes.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or
time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
While the interpretation of "large number of parent classes" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ recommends a default
maximum of 7 parent classes.
