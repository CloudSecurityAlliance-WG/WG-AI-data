CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier
Weakness ID: 694
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses multiple resources that can have the same identifier , in a context in which unique identifiers are required.
 Extended Description
If the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier , the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can
cause multiple resources to be associated with the same identifier .

Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
If unique identifiers are assumed when protecting sensitive resources, then duplicate identifiers
might allow attackers to bypass the protection.

3/7/24, 3:08 PM CWE - CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identiﬁer (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/694.html 2/2It is not certain which form will be used by Struts. It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the
rest of the product.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2013-4787 chain: mobile OS verifies cryptographic signature of file in an archive, but then installs a dif ferent file
with the same name that is also listed in the archive.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Where possible, use unique identifiers. If non-unique identifiers are detected, then do not operate any resource with a non-
unique identifier and report the error appropriately .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
This weakness is probably closely associated with other issues related to doubling, such as CWE-675 (Duplicate Operations on
Resource). It's often a case of an API contract violation ( CWE-227 ).
