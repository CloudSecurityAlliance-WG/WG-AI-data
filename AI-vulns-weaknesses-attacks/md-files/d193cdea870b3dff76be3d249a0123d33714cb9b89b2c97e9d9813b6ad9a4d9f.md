CWE-496: Public Data Assigned to Private Array-T yped Field
Weakness ID: 496
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
Assigning public data to a private array is equivalent to giving public access to the array .

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data
The contents of the array can be modified from outside the intended scope.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the example below , the setRoles() method assigns a publically-controllable array to a private field, thus allowing the caller to modify
the private array directly by virtue of the fact that arrays in Java are mutable.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Do not allow objects to modify private members of a class.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
