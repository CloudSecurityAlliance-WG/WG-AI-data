CWE-1116: Inaccurate Comments
Weakness ID: 1116
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The source code contains comments that do not accurately describe or explain aspects of the portion of the code with which the
comment is associated.
 Extended Description
When a comment does not accurately reflect the associated code elements, this can introduce confusion to a reviewer (due to
inconsistencies) or make it more dif ficult and less ef ficient to validate that the code is implementing the intended behavior correctly .
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-consuming
to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example the code performs a calculation to determine how much medicine to administer . A comment is provided
to give insight into what the calculation shoud be doing. Unfortunately the comment does not match the actual code and thus leaves
the reader to wonder which is correct.
In the correction below , the code functionality has been verified, and the comment has been corrected to reflect the proper calculation.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

int mg\_per\_kg = 3;
int daily\_dose = 0;
// Add the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Verify that each comment accurately reflects what is intended to happen during execution of the code.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
