CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Weakness ID: 749
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the
interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.
 Extended Description
This weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to
any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on.
The exposure can occur in a few dif ferent ways:
The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors.
The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a
single web site.

Exposing critical functionality essentially provides an attacker with the privilege level of the exposed
functionality . This could result in the modification or exposure of sensitive data or possibly even
execution of arbitrary code.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/749.html 2/4The method in this example is declared public and therefore is exposed to any class in the application. Deleting a database should be
considered a critical operation within an application and access to this potentially dangerous method should be restricted. Within Java
this can be accomplished simply by declaring the method private thereby exposing it only to the enclosing class as in the following
example.
Example 2
These Android and iOS applications intercept URL loading within a W ebView and perform special actions if a particular URL scheme
is used, thus allowing the Javascript within the W ebView to communicate with the application:
A call into native code can then be initiated by passing parameters within the URL:
Because the application does not check the source, a malicious website loaded within this W ebView has the same access to the API
as a trusted site.
Example 3
This application uses a W ebView to display websites, and creates a Javascript interface to a Java object to allow enhanced
functionality on a trusted website:Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
} catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 
private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
try {
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
} catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
// Android
@Override
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){
writeDataToView(view, UserData);
return false;
}
else{
return true;
}
}
}
(bad code) Example Language: Objective-C 
// iOS
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView \*)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest \*)exRequest navigationType:
(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType
{
NSURL \*URL = [exRequest URL];
if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"])
{
NSString \*functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"])
{
// Make data available back in webview.
UIWebView \*webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
}
return NO;
}
return YES;
}

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/749.html 3/4Before Android 4.2 all methods, including inherited ones, are exposed to Javascript when using addJavascriptInterface(). This means
that a malicious website loaded within this W ebView can use reflection to acquire a reference to arbitrary Java objects. This will allow
the website code to perform any action the parent application is authorized to.
For example, if the application has permission to send text messages:
This malicious script can use the userInfoObject object to load the SmsManager object and send arbitrary text messages to any
recipient.
Example 4
After Android 4.2, only methods annotated with @JavascriptInterface are available in JavaScript, protecting usage of getClass() by
default, as in this example:
This code is not vulnerable to the above attack, but still may expose user info to malicious pages loaded in the W ebView. Even
malicious iframes loaded within a trusted page may access the exposed interface:
This malicious code within an iframe is able to access the interface object and steal the user's data.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
If you must expose a method, make sure to perform input validation on all arguments, limit access to authorized parties, and
protect against all possible vulnerabilities.
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction
Identify all exposed functionality . Explicitly list all functionality that must be exposed to some user or set of users. Identify which
functionality may be:
accessible to all userspublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
mainWebView = new WebView(this);
mainWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
mainWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new JavaScriptInterface(), "userInfoObject");
mainWebView.loadUrl("file:///android\_asset/www/index.html");
setContentView(mainWebView);
}
final class JavaScriptInterface {
JavaScriptInterface () {}
public String getUserInfo() {
return currentUser.Info();
}
}
}
(attack code) Example Language: JavaScript 

userInfoObject.getClass().forName('android.telephony.SmsManager').getMethod('getDefault',null).sendTextMessage(attackNumber,
null, attackMessage, null, null);

(bad code) Example Language: Java 
final class JavaScriptInterface {
JavaScriptInterface () { }
@JavascriptInterface
public String getUserInfo() {
return currentUser.Info();
}
}
(attack code) Example Language: JavaScript 

var info = window.userInfoObject.getUserInfo();
sendUserInfo(info);

prevented from being directly accessible at all
Ensure that the implemented code follows these expectations. This includes setting the appropriate access modifiers where
applicable (public, private, protected, etc.) or not marking ActiveX controls safe-for-scripting.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Research Gap
Under-reported and under-studied. This weakness could appear in any technology , language, or framework that allows the
programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable
increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These
weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE,
which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community .
