CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
Weakness ID: 662
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one
process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by
multiple threads or processes.
 Extended Description
Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or
threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other . Some shared
resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially , without any
interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely , but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores.
When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting
behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/662.html 2/3However , the code does not check the value returned by pthread\_mutex\_lock() for errors. If pthread\_mutex\_lock() cannot acquire the
mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior .
In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately
handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.
Example 2
The following code intends to fork a process, then have both the parent and child processes print a single line.
One might expect the code to print out something like:
PARENT
child
However , because the parent and child are executing concurrently , and stdout is flushed each time a character is printed, the output
might be mixed together , such as:

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:
Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
 Notes
Maintenance
Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other
mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency , race conditions, reentrant
functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667 , CWE-820 , CWE-821 , and others - may need to be modified
significantly , along with their relationships.
