CWE-82: Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes of IMG T ags in a W eb Page
Weakness ID: 82
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The web application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes scripting elements within attributes of HTML IMG tags, such as the
src attribute.
 Extended Description
Attackers can embed XSS exploits into the values for IMG attributes (e.g. SRC) that is streamed and then executed in a victim's
browser . Note that when the page is loaded into a user's browsers, the exploit will automatically execute.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Output Encoding
Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common
encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a
different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be
erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as
special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct
injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being
used by the downstream component.
The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header , web
browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction
To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly . In browsers that support
the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session
cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since
HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly , XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies
provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
