 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code takes untrusted input and uses a regular expression to filter "../" from the input. It then appends this result to the
/home/user/ directory and attempts to read the file in the final resulting path.
Since the regular expression does not have the /g global match modifier , it only removes the first instance of "../" it comes across. So
an input value such as:
will have the first "../" stripped, resulting in:
This value is then concatenated with the /home/user/ directory:
which causes the /etc/passwd file to be retrieved once the operating system has resolved the ../ sequences in the pathname. This
leads to relative path traversal ( CWE-23 ).About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼
