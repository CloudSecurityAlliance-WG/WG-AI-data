Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses too much self-modifying code.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to understand or maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or
time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
