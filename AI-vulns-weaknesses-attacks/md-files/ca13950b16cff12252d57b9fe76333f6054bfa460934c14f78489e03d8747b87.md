CWE-1060: Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses
Weakness ID: 1060
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product performs too many data queries without using ef ficient data processing functionality such as stored procedures.
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker ,
then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability .
While the interpretation of "too many data queries" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ recommends a default maximum of
5 data queries for an inef ficient function/procedure.
