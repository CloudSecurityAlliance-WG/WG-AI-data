 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example the updateUserAccountOrder() method used within an e-business product ordering/inventory
application will validate the product number that was ordered and the user account number . If they are valid, the method will update
the product inventory , the user account, and the user order appropriately .About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public void updateUserAccountOrder(String productNumber, String accountNumber) {
boolean isValidProduct = false;
boolean isValidAccount = false;
if (validProductNumber(productNumber)) {
isValidProduct = true;
updateInventory(productNumber);
}
else {
return;
}
if (validAccountNumber(accountNumber)) {
isValidProduct = true;
updateAccount(accountNumber, productNumber);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/570.html 2/3However , the method never sets the isV alidAccount variable after initializing it to false so the isV alidProduct is mistakenly used twice.
The result is that the expression "isV alidProduct && isV alidAccount" will always evaluate to false, so the updateAccountOrder()
method will never be invoked. This will create serious problems with the product ordering application since the user account and
inventory databases will be updated but the order will not be updated.
This can be easily corrected by updating the appropriate variable.
Example 2
In the following example, the hasReadW riteAccess method uses bit masks and bit operators to determine if a user has read and write
privileges for a particular process. The variable mask is defined as a bit mask from the BIT\_READ and BIT\_WRITE constants that
have been defined. The variable mask is used within the predicate of the hasReadW riteAccess method to determine if the userMask
input parameter has the read and write bits set.
However the bit operator used to initialize the mask variable is the AND operator rather than the intended OR operator ( CWE-480 ),
this resulted in the variable mask being set to 0. As a result, the if statement will always evaluate to false and never get executed.
The use of bit masks, bit operators and bitwise operations on variables can be dif ficult. If possible, try to use frameworks or libraries
that provide appropriate functionality and abstract the implementation.
Example 3
In the following example, the updateInventory method used within an e-business inventory application will update the inventory for a
particular product. This method includes an if statement with an expression that will always evaluate to false. This is a common
practice in C/C++ to introduce debugging statements quickly by simply changing the expression to evaluate to true and then removing
those debugging statements by changing expression to evaluate to false. This is also a common practice for disabling features no
longer needed.}

(bad code) Example Language: C 
#define BIT\_READ 0x0001 // 00000001
#define BIT\_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000
unsigned int mask = BIT\_READ & BIT\_WRITE; /\* intended to use "|" \*/
// using "&", mask = 00000000
// using "|", mask = 00010001
// determine if user has read and write access
int hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) {
// if the userMask has read and write bits set
// then return 1 (true)
if (userMask & mask) {
return 1;
}
// otherwise return 0 (false)
return 0;
}
(bad code) Example Language: C 
int updateInventory(char\* productNumber, int numberOfItems) {
int initCount = getProductCount(productNumber);
int updatedCount = initCount + numberOfItems;
int updated = updateProductCount(updatedCount);
// if statement for debugging purposes only
if (1 == 0) {
char productName[128];
productName = getProductName(productNumber);
printf("product %s initially has %d items in inventory \n", productName, initCount);
printf("adding %d items to inventory for %s \n", numberOfItems, productName);
if (updated == 0) {
printf("Inventory updated for product %s to %d items \n", productName, updatedCount);

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/570.html 3/3Using this practice for introducing debugging statements or disabling features creates dead code that can cause problems during
code maintenance and potentially introduce vulnerabilities. To avoid using expressions that evaluate to false for debugging purposes
a logging API or debugging API should be used for the output of debugging messages.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: T esting
Use Static Analysis tools to spot such conditions.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
