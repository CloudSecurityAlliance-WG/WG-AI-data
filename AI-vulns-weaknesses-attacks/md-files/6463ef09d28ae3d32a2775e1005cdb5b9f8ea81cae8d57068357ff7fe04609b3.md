CWE-624: Executable Regular Expression Error
Weakness ID: 624
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a regular expression that either (1) contains an executable component with user-controlled inputs, or (2) allows a
user to enable execution by inserting pattern modifiers.
 Extended Description
Case (2) is possible in the PHP preg\_replace() function, and possibly in other languages when a user-controlled input is inserted into
a string that is later parsed as a regular expression.

Reference Description
CVE-2006-2059 Executable regexp in PHP by inserting "e" modifier into first argument to preg\_replace
CVE-2005-3420 Executable regexp in PHP by inserting "e" modifier into first argument to preg\_replace
CVE-2006-2878 Complex curly syntax inserted into the replacement argument to PHP preg\_replace(), which uses the
"/e" modifier
CVE-2006-2908 Function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the username field, which is used
in a preg\_replace function call with a /e (executable) modifier .
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
The regular expression feature in some languages allows inputs to be quoted or escaped before insertion, such as \Q and \E in
Perl.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Research Gap
Under-studied. The existing PHP reports are limited to highly skilled researchers, but there are few examples for other languages. It
is suspected that this is under-reported for all languages. Usability factors might make it more prevalent in PHP , but this theory has
not been investigated.
