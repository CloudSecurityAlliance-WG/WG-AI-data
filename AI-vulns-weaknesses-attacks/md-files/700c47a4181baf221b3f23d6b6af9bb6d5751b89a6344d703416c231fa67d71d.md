CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
Weakness ID: 294
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to snif f network traf fic and bypass
authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same ef fect as the original message (or with minor changes).
 Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be dif ficult to defeat without cryptography . They are a subset of network injection attacks
that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands
to the server .

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
Messages sent with a capture-relay attack allow access to resources which are not otherwise
accessible without proper authentication.
 Likelihood Of Exploit
High
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2005-3435 product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can
be subjected to replay attacks.
CVE-2007-4961 Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password ( CWE-319 ) enables attacks against a
server that is susceptible to replay ( CWE-294 ).
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Utilize some sequence or time stamping functionality along with a checksum which takes this into account in order to ensure that
messages can be parsed only once.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/294.html 2/2Since any attacker who can listen to traf fic can see sequence numbers, it is necessary to sign messages with some kind of
cryptography to ensure that sequence numbers are not simply doctored along with content.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
