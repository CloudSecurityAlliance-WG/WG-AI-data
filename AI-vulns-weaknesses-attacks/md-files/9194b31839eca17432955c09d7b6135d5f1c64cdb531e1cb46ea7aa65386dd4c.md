 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In 2022, the OT :ICEF ALL study examined products by 10 dif ferent Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56
vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [ REF-1283 ]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed
adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/345.html 2/3Since these products were often used in industries such as power , electrical, water , and others, there could even be safety
implications.
Multiple vendors did not sign firmware images.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-30260 Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure
checksums for integrity checks
CVE-2022-30267 Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure
checksums for integrity checks
CVE-2022-30272 Remote Terminal Unit (R TU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure
checksums
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:
Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
 Notes
Relationship
"origin validation" could fall under this.
Maintenance
The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is
more like a category .
