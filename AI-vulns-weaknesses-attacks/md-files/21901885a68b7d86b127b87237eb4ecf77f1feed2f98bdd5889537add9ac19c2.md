CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Weakness ID: 284
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor .
 Extended Description
Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges,
reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for
example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be
performed by the program or the administrator .
Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements
(e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings).
This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the
administrator specifies.
 Alternate T erms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably , although many people have
distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various
mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly
defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation
Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
Phase: Architecture and Design
3/7/24, 2:55 PM CWE - CWE-284: Improper Access Control (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/284.html 3/4Strategy: Separation of Privilege
Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive
data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.
Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and
reinforces privilege separation functionality . Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the
appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reasons: Frequent Misuse, Abstraction
Rationale:
CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar . Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability
reports [ REF-1287 ] or by active use of the OW ASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend
analysis.
Comments:
Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving
authorization (Missing Authorization ( CWE-862 ), Incorrect Authorization ( CWE-863 ), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical
Resource ( CWE-732 ), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication ( CWE-306 ) or W eak Authentication ( CWE-1390 )); Incorrect
User Management ( CWE-286 ); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints ( CWE-923 ); etc.
Suggestions:
CWE-ID Comment
CWE-862 Missing Authorization
CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization
CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
CWE-306 Missing Authentication
CWE-1390 Weak Authentication
CWE-923 Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
