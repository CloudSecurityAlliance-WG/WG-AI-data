Weakness ID: 1067
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains a data query against an SQL table or view that is configured in a way that does not utilize an index and may
cause sequential searches to be performed.
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this performance problem
might introduce a vulnerability .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
