CWE-1285: Improper V alidation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
Weakness ID: 1285
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or of fset into an indexable resource such as a buf fer or file,
but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/of fset has the required properties.
 Extended Description
Often, indexable resources such as memory buf fers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or of fset, such as an
index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could
access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buf fer overflows, excessive
resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following example retrieves the sizes of messages for a pop3 mail server . The message sizes are retrieved from a socket that
returns in a buf fer the message number and the message size, the message number (num) and size (size) are extracted from the
buffer and the message size is placed into an array using the message number for the array index.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1285.html 2/4In this example the message number retrieved from the buf fer could be a value that is outside the allowable range of indices for the
array and could possibly be a negative number . Without proper validation of the value to be used for the array index an array overflow
could occur and could potentially lead to unauthorized access to memory addresses and system crashes. The value of the array index
should be validated to ensure that it is within the allowable range of indices for the array as in the following code.
Example 2
In the following example the method displayProductSummary is called from a W eb service servlet to retrieve product summary
information for display to the user . The servlet obtains the integer value of the product number from the user and passes it to the
displayProductSummary method. The displayProductSummary method passes the integer value of the product number to the
getProductSummary method which obtains the product summary from the array object containing the project summaries using the
integer value of the product number as the array index.
In this example the integer value used as the array index that is provided by the user may be outside the allowable range of indices
for the array which may provide unexpected results or cause the application to fail. The integer value used for the array index should
be validated to ensure that it is within the allowable range of indices for the array as in the following code.// continue read from socket until buf only contains '.'
if (DOTLINE(buf))
break;
else if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", #, &size) == 2)
sizes[num - 1] = size;
}
...
}
(good code) Example Language: C 
/\* capture the sizes of all messages \*/
int getsizes(int sock, int count, int \*sizes) {
...
char buf[BUFFER\_SIZE];
int ok;
int num, size;
// read values from socket and added to sizes array
while ((ok = gen\_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) == 0)
{
// continue read from socket until buf only contains '.'
if (DOTLINE(buf))
break;
else if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", #, &size) == 2) {
if (num > 0 && num <= (unsigned)count)
sizes[num - 1] = size;
else
/\* warn about possible attempt to induce buffer overflow \*/
report(stderr, "Warning: ignoring bogus data for message sizes returned by server.\n");
}
}
...
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
String productSummary = new String("");
try {
String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
} catch (Exception ex) {...}
return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
return products[index];
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 3/7/24, 2:47 PM CWE - CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Speciﬁed Index, Position, or Oﬀset in Input (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1285.html 3/4An alternative in Java would be to use one of the collection objects such as ArrayList that will automatically generate an exception if
an attempt is made to access an array index that is out of bounds.
Example 3
The following example asks a user for an of fset into an array to select an item.
The programmer allows the user to specify which element in the list to select, however an attacker can provide an out-of-bounds
offset, resulting in a buf fer over-read ( CWE-126 ).

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy , i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that
strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something
that does.
When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of
acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an
example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not
valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."
Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input,
especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However ,
denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected
outright.
Effectiveness: High// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
String productSummary = new String("");
try {
String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
} catch (Exception ex) {...}
return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
String productSummary = "";
if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX\_PRODUCTS)) {
productSummary = products[index];
}
else {
System.err.println("index is out of bounds");
throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
}
return productSummary;
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 
ArrayList productArray = new ArrayList(MAX\_PRODUCTS);
...
try {
productSummary = (String) productArray.get(index);
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {...}
(bad code) Example Language: C 
int main (int argc, char \*\*argv) {
char \*items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};
int index = GetUntrustedOffset();
printf("User selected %s\n", items[index-1]);

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
