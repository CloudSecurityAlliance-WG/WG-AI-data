CWE-593: Authentication Bypass: OpenSSL CTX Object Modified after SSL Objects
are Created
Weakness ID: 593
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product modifies the SSL context after connection creation has begun.
 Extended Description
If the program modifies the SSL\_CTX object after creating SSL objects from it, there is the possibility that older SSL objects created
from the original context could all be af fected by that change.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
No authentication takes place in this process, bypassing an assumed protection of encryption.
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
The encrypted communication between a user and a trusted host may be subject to a snif fing
attack.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a language or a library that provides a cryptography framework at a higher level of abstraction.
Phase: Implementation
Most SSL\_CTX functions have SSL counterparts that act on SSL-type objects.
Phase: Implementation
Applications should set up an SSL\_CTX completely , before creating SSL objects from it.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
