CWE-673: External Influence of Sphere Definition
Weakness ID: 673
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not prevent the definition of control spheres from external actors.
 Extended Description
Typically , a product defines its control sphere within the code itself, or through configuration by the product's administrator . In some
cases, an external party can change the definition of the control sphere. This is typically a resultant weakness.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Consider a blog publishing tool, which might have three explicit control spheres: the creation of articles, only accessible to a
"publisher;" commenting on articles, only accessible to a "commenter" who is a registered user; and reading articles, only accessible
to an anonymous reader . Suppose that the application is deployed on a web server that is shared with untrusted parties. If a local
user can modify the data files that define who a publisher is, then this user has modified the control sphere. In this case, the issue
would be resultant from another weakness such as insuf ficient permissions.
Example 2
In Untrusted Search Path ( CWE-426 ), a user might be able to define the P ATH environment variable to cause the product to search in
the wrong directory for a library to load. The product's intended sphere of control would include "resources that are only modifiable by
the person who installed the product." The P ATH ef fectively changes the definition of this sphere so that it overlaps the attacker's
sphere of control.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2008-2613 setuid program allows compromise using path that finds and loads a malicious library .

 Notes
Theoretical
A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor , or a group of actors. A product's security
model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly . For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators"
who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who
can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating
system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has dif ferent sets of actors and allowable behaviors.
