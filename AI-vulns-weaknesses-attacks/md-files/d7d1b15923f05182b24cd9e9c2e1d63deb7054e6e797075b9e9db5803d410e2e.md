View customized information:
 Description
The System-on-Chip (SoC) does not have unique, immutable identifiers for each of its components.
 Extended Description
A System-on-Chip (SoC) comprises several components (IP) with varied trust requirements. It is required that each IP is identified
uniquely and should distinguish itself from other entities in the SoC without any ambiguity . The unique secured identity is required for
various purposes. Most of the time the identity is used to route a transaction or perform certain actions, including resetting, retrieving
a sensitive information, and acting upon or on behalf of something else.
There are several variants of this weakness:
A "missing" identifier is when the SoC does not define any mechanism to uniquely identify the IP .
An "insuf ficient" identifier might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not
protect against everything that is intended.
A "misconfigured" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available but not implemented correctly .
An "ignored" identifier occurs when the SoC/IP has not applied any policies or does not act upon the identifier securely .

Every identity generated in the SoC should be unique and immutable in hardware. The actions that an IP is trusted or not trusted
should be clearly defined, implemented, configured, and tested. If the definition is implemented via a policy , then the policy
should be immutable or protected with clear authentication and authorization.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
