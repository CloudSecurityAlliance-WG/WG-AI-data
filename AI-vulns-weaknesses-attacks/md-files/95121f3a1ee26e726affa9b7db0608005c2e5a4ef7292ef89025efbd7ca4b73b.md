Weakness ID: 758
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses an API function, data structure, or other entity in a way that relies on properties that are not always guaranteed to
hold for that entity .
 Extended Description
This can lead to resultant weaknesses when the required properties change, such as when the product is ported to a dif ferent
platform or if an interaction error ( CWE-435 ) occurs.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This code assumes a particular function will always be found at a particular address. It assigns a pointer to that address and calls the
function.
The same function may not always be found at the same memory address. This could lead to a crash, or an attacker may alter the
memory at the expected address, leading to arbitrary code execution.
Example 2
The following function returns a stack address.

behaviors that were undefined in the C standard.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Fuzzing
Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
