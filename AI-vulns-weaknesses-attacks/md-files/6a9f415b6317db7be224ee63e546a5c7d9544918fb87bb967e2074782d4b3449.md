CWE-498: Cloneable Class Containing Sensitive Information
Weakness ID: 498
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The code contains a class with sensitive data, but the class is cloneable. The data can then be accessed by cloning the class.
 Extended Description
Cloneable classes are ef fectively open classes, since data cannot be hidden in them. Classes that do not explicitly deny cloning can
be cloned by any other class without running the constructor .

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
A class that can be cloned can be produced without executing the constructor . This is dangerous
since the constructor may perform security-related checks. By allowing the object to be cloned,
those checks may be bypassed.

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
If you do make your classes clonable, ensure that your clone method is final and throw super .clone().

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
