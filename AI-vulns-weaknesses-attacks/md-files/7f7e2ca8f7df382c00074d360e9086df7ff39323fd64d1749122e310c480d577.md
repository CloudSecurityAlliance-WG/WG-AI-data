CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication
Weakness ID: 308
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor
authentication scheme.
 Extended Description
While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on more complexity on top of authentication, it is inestimably
valuable to have such measures of redundancy . The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet.
Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For
this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented and required.

Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
If the secret in a single-factor authentication scheme gets compromised, full authentication is
possible.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/308.html 2/3This code relies exclusively on a password mechanism ( CWE-309 ) using only one factor of authentication ( CWE-308 ). If an attacker
can steal or guess a user's password, they are given full access to their account. Note this code also uses SHA-1, which is a weak
hash ( CWE-328 ). It also does not use a salt ( CWE-759 ).
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-35248 Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, ef fectively
removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use multiple independent authentication schemes, which ensures that -- if one of the methods is compromised -- the system
itself is still likely safe from compromise.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
