CWE-576: EJB Bad Practices: Use of Java I/O

View customized information:
 Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using the java.io package.
 Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure
that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container . In this case, the product violates the following EJB
guideline: "An enterprise bean must not use the java.io package to attempt to access files and directories in the file system." The
specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "The file system APIs are not well-suited for business components to
access data. Business components should use a resource manager API, such as JDBC, to store data."

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following Java example is a simple stateless Enterprise JavaBean that retrieves the interest rate for the number of points for a
mortgage. In this example, the interest rates for various points are retrieved from an XML document on the local file system, and the
EJB uses the Java I/O API to retrieve the XML document from the local file system.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/576.html 2/2This use of the Java I/O API within any kind of Enterprise JavaBean violates the EJB specification by using the java.io package for
accessing files within the local filesystem.
An Enterprise JavaBean should use a resource manager API for storing and accessing data. In the following example, the private
member function getInterestRateFromXMLParser uses an XML parser API to retrieve the interest rates.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Do not use Java I/O when writing EJBs.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
