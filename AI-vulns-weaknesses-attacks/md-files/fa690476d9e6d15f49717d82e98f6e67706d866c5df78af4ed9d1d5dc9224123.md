CWE-1255: Comparison Logic is V ulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks
Weakness ID: 1255
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A device's real time power consumption may be monitored during security token evaluation and the information gleaned may be used
to determine the value of the reference token.
 Extended Description
The power consumed by a device may be instrumented and monitored in real time. If the algorithm for evaluating security tokens is
not suf ficiently robust, the power consumption may vary by token entry comparison against the reference value. Further , if retries are
unlimited, the power dif ference between a "good" entry and a "bad" entry may be observed and used to determine whether each entry
itself is correct thereby allowing unauthorized parties to calculate the reference value.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1255.html 2/4Consider an example hardware module that checks a user-provided password (or PIN) to grant access to a user . The user-provided
password is compared against a stored value byte-by-byte.
Since the algorithm uses a dif ferent number of 1's and 0's for password validation, a dif ferent amount of power is consumed for the
good byte versus the bad byte comparison. Using this information, an attacker may be able to guess the correct password for that
byte-by-byte iteration with several repeated attempts by stopping the password evaluation before it completes.
Among various options for mitigating the string comparison is obscuring the power consumption by having opposing bit flips during bit
operations. Note that in this example, the initial change of the bit values could still provide power indication depending upon the
hardware itself. This possibility needs to be measured for verification.
Example 2
This code demonstrates the transfer of a secret key using Serial-In/Serial-Out shift. It's easy to extract the secret using simple power
analysis as each shift gives data on a single bit of the key .
This code demonstrates the transfer of a secret key using a Parallel-In/Parallel-Out shift. In a parallel shift, data confounded by
multiple bits of the key , not just one.(bad code) Example Language: C 
static nonvolatile password\_tries = NUM\_RETRIES;
do
while (password\_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
password\_ok = 0;
for (i = 0; i < NUM\_PW\_DIGITS; i++)
if (GetPasswordByte() == stored\_password([i])
password\_ok |= 1; // Power consumption is different here
else
password\_ok |= 0; // than from here
end
if (password\_ok > 0)
password\_tries = NUM\_RETRIES;
break\_to\_Ok\_to\_proceed
password\_tries--;
while (true)
// Password OK
(good code) Example Language: C 
static nonvolatile password\_tries = NUM\_RETRIES;
do
while (password\_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
password\_tries--; // Put retry code here to catch partial retries
password\_ok = 0;
for (i = 0; i < NUM\_PW\_DIGITS; i++)
if (GetPasswordByte() == stored\_password([i])
password\_ok |= 0x10; // Power consumption here
else
password\_ok |= 0x01; // is now the same here
end
if ((password\_ok & 1) == 0)
password\_tries = NUM\_RETRIES;
break\_to\_Ok\_to\_proceed
while (true)
// Password OK
(bad code) Example Language: Verilog 
module siso(clk,rst,a,q);
input a;
input clk,rst;
output q;
reg q;
always@(posedge clk,posedge rst)
begin
if(rst==1'b1)
