CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
Weakness ID: 697
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant
weaknesses.
 Extended Description
This Pillar covers several possibilities:
the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;
the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;
the comparison checks the wrong factor .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/697.html 2/4Here, the equals() method only checks the make and model of the Truck objects, but the year of manufacture is not included.
Example 2
This example defines a fixed username and password. The AuthenticateUser() function is intended to accept a username and a
password from an untrusted user , and check to ensure that it matches the username and password. If the username and password
match, AuthenticateUser() is intended to indicate that authentication succeeded.
In AuthenticateUser(), the strncmp() call uses the string length of an attacker-provided inPass parameter in order to determine how
many characters to check in the password. So, if the attacker only provides a password of length 1, the check will only examine the
first byte of the application's password before determining success.
As a result, this partial comparison leads to improper authentication ( CWE-287 ).
Any of these passwords would still cause authentication to succeed for the "admin" user:
This significantly reduces the search space for an attacker , making brute force attacks more feasible.
The same problem also applies to the username, so values such as "a" and "adm" will succeed for the username.
While this demonstrative example may not seem realistic, see the Observed Examples for CVE entries that ef fectively reflect this
same weakness.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-3116 Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators ( CWE-480 ) causing an
incorrect comparison ( CWE-697 ) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met insteadpublic boolean equals(Object o) {
if (o == null) return false;
if (o == this) return true;
if (!(o instanceof Truck)) return false;
Truck t = (Truck) o;
return (this.make.equals(t.getMake()) && this.model.equals(t.getModel()));
}
}
(bad code) Example Language: C 
/\* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. \*/
char \*username = "admin";

}
if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {
logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");
return(AUTH\_SUCCESS);
}
else {
logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");

}
}

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar . However , sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-
depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.
Comments:
Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
 Notes
Research Gap
Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic
and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational dif ficulties within CWE.
Maintenance
This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity ( CWE-178 ), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses
besides comparison. Also, in cryptography , certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in
constant time, causing a timing-related information leak ( CWE-208 ).
