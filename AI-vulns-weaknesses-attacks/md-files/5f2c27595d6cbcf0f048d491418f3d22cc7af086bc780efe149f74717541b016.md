CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
Weakness ID: 639
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying
the key value identifying the data.
 Extended Description
Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a
user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user . It is likely that an
attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However , the authorization process would not properly check the data
access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has suf ficient entitlements to perform the requested
data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.
For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key
for the item being looked up is controllable externally . The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a
URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.
One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one
user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.
 Alternate T erms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OW ASP Top
Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal ( CWE-22 ).
Within the context of vulnerability theory , there is a similarity between the
OWASP concept and CWE-706 : Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or
Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OW ASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the
same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have
the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's
resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a
multi-user context.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
Access control checks for specific user data or functionality can be bypassed.
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
Horizontal escalation of privilege is possible (one user can view/modify information of another user).
Access ControlTechnical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
Vertical escalation of privilege is possible if the user-controlled key is actually a flag that indicates
administrator status, allowing the attacker to gain administrative access.
 Likelihood Of Exploit
High
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to
construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a
list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user .
The problem is that the developer has not considered all of the possible values of id. Although the interface generates a list of invoice
identifiers that belong to the current user , an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in
this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if
it does not belong to the current user .
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-36539 An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user . The attacker can
brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
For each and every data access, ensure that the user has suf ficient privilege to access the record that is being requested.
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Make sure that the key that is used in the lookup of a specific user's record is not controllable externally by the user or that any
tampering can be detected.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use encryption in order to make it more dif ficult to guess other legitimate values of the key or associate a digital signature with
the key so that the server can verify that there has been no tampering.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
