CWE-432: Dangerous Signal Handler not Disabled During Sensitive Operations
Weakness ID: 432
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses a signal handler that shares state with other signal handlers, but it does not properly mask or prevent those signal
handlers from being invoked while the original signal handler is still running.
 Extended Description
During the execution of a signal handler , it can be interrupted by another handler when a dif ferent signal is sent. If the two handlers
share state - such as global variables - then an attacker can corrupt the state by sending another signal before the first handler has
completed execution.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
