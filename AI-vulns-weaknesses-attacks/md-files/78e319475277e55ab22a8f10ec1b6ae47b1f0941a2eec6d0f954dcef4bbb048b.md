CWE-48: Path Equivalence: 'file name' (Internal Whitespace)
Weakness ID: 48
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product accepts path input in the form of internal space ('file(SP ACE)name') without appropriate validation, which can lead to
ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

Reference Description
CVE-2000-0293 Filenames with spaces allow arbitrary file deletion when the product does not properly quote them;
some overlap with path traversal.
CVE-2001-1567 "+" characters in query string converted to spaces before sensitive file/extension (internal space),
leading to bypass of access restrictions to the file.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/48.html 2/2This weakness is likely to overlap quoting problems, e.g. the "Program Files" unquoted search path ( CWE-428 ). It also could be an
equivalence issue if filtering removes all extraneous spaces.
Relationship
Whitespace can be a factor in other weaknesses not directly related to equivalence. It can also be used to spoof icons or hide files
with dangerous names (see icon manipulation and visual truncation in CWE-451 ).
