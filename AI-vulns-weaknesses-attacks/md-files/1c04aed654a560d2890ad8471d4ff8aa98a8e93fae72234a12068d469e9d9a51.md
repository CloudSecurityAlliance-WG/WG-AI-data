CWE-382: J2EE Bad Practices: Use of System.exit()
Weakness ID: 382
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
A J2EE application uses System.exit(), which also shuts down its container .
 Extended Description
It is never a good idea for a web application to attempt to shut down the application container . Access to a function that can shut down
the application is an avenue for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 705 Incorrect Control Flow Scoping
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation A call to System.exit() is probably part of leftover debug code or code imported from a non-J2EE application.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Java (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
Included in the doPost() method defined below is a call to System.exit() in the event of a specific exception.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Separation of Privilege
The shutdown function should be a privileged function available only to a properly authorized administrative user
Phase: Implementation
Web applications should not call methods that cause the virtual machine to exit, such as System.exit()
Phase: Implementation
Web applications should also not throw any Throwables to the application server as this may adversely af fect the container .

other locations in the code
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
