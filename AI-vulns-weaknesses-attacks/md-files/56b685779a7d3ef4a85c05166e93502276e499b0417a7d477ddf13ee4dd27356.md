 Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using sockets.
 Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure
that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container . In this case, the product violates the following EJB
guideline: "An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen on a socket, accept connections on a socket, or use a socket for multicast."
The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "The EJB architecture allows an enterprise bean instance to be a
network socket client, but it does not allow it to be a network server . Allowing the instance to become a network server would conflict
with the basic function of the enterprise bean-- to serve the EJB clients."

Example 1
The following Java example is a simple stateless Enterprise JavaBean that retrieves stock symbols and stock values. The Enterprise
JavaBean creates a socket and listens for and accepts connections from clients on the socket.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

Enterprise JavaBean.
The previous two examples within any type of Enterprise JavaBean violate the EJB specification by attempting to listen on a socket,
accepting connections on a socket, or using a socket for multicast.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Do not use Sockets when writing EJBs.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
