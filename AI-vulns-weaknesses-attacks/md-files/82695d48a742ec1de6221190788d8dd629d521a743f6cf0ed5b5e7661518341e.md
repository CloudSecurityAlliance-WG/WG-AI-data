 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: DoS: Amplification; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource
Consumption (Memory)
System resources, CPU and memory , can be quickly consumed. This can lead to poor system
performance or system crash.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This function prints the contents of a specified file requested by a user .
This code first reads a specified file into memory , then prints the file if the user is authorized to see its contents. The read of the file
into memory may be resource intensive and is unnecessary if the user is not allowed to see the file anyway .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
