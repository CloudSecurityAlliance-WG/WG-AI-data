CWE-670: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation
Weakness ID: 670
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement, leading to incorrect
behavior any time this path is navigated.
 Extended Description
This weakness captures cases in which a particular code segment is always incorrect with respect to the algorithm that it is
implementing. For example, if a C programmer intends to include multiple statements in a single block but does not include the
enclosing braces ( CWE-483 ), then the logic is always incorrect. This issue is in contrast to most weaknesses in which the code
usually behaves correctly , except when it is externally manipulated in malicious ways.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
ImplementationThis issue typically appears in rarely-tested code, since the "always-incorrect" nature will be detected as a bug
during normal usage.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This code queries a server and displays its status when a request comes from an authorized IP address.
This code redirects unauthorized users, but continues to execute code after calling http\_redirect(). This means even unauthorized
users may be able to access the contents of the page or perform a DoS attack on the server being queried. Also, note that this code is
vulnerable to an IP address spoofing attack ( CWE-212 ).
Example 2
In this example, the programmer has indented the statements to call Do\_X() and Do\_Y(), as if the intention is that these functions are
only called when the condition is true. However , because there are no braces to signify the block, Do\_Y() will always be executed,About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

This might not be what the programmer intended. When the condition is critical for security , such as in making a security decision or
detecting a critical error , this may produce a vulnerability .
Example 3
In both of these examples, a message is printed based on the month passed into the function:
Both examples do not use a break statement after each case, which leads to unintended fall-through behavior . For example, calling
"printMessage(10)" will result in the text "OctoberNovemberDecember is a great month" being printed.
Example 4
In the excerpt below , an AssertionError (an unchecked exception) is thrown if the user hasn't entered an email address in an HTML
form.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-3011 virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid
value to a register , which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code

Usage: ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW
(this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:
Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
 Notes
Maintenance
This node could possibly be split into lower-level nodes. "Early Return" is for returning control to the caller too soon (e.g., CWE-584 ).
"Excess Return" is when control is returned too far up the call stack ( CWE-600 , CWE-395 ). "Improper control limitation" occurs when
the product maintains control at a lower level of execution, when control should be returned "further" up the call stack ( CWE-455 ).
"Incorrect syntax" covers code that's "just plain wrong" such as CWE-484 and CWE-483 .
