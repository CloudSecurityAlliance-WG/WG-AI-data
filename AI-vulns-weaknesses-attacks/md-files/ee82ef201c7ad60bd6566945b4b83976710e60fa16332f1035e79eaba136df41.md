CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
Weakness ID: 93
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize
or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation REALIZA TION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms

Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
If user input data that eventually makes it to a log message isn't checked for CRLF characters, it may be possible for an attacker to
forge entries in a log file.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2002-1771 CRLF injection enables spam proxy (add mail headers) using email address or name.
CVE-2002-1783 CRLF injection in API function arguments modify headers for outgoing requests.
CVE-2004-1513 Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns
CVE-2006-4624 Chain: inject fake log entries with fake timestamps using CRLF injection
CVE-2005-1951 Chain: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.
CVE-2004-1687 Chain: HTTP response splitting via CRLF in parameter related to URL.

Avoid using CRLF as a special sequence.
Phase: Implementation
Appropriately filter or quote CRLF sequences in user-controlled input.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
