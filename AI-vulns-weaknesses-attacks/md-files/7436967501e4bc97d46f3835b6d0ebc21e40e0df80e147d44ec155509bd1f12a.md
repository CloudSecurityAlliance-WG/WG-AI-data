CWE-1105: Insufficient Encapsulation of Machine-Dependent Functionality
Weakness ID: 1105
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product or code uses machine-dependent functionality , but it does not suf ficiently encapsulate or isolate this functionality from the
rest of the code.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to port or maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-
consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In this example function, the memory address of variable b is derived by adding 1 to the address of variable a. This derived address is
then used to assign the value 0 to b.
Here, b may not be one byte past a. It may be one byte in front of a. Or , they may have three bytes between them because they are
aligned on 32-bit boundaries.

Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1105.html 2/2Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
Comments:
Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.
