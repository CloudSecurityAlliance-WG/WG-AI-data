CWE-589: Call to Non-ubiquitous API
Weakness ID: 589
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses an API function that does not exist on all versions of the target platform. This could cause portability problems or
inconsistencies that allow denial of service or other consequences.
 Extended Description
Some functions that of fer security features supported by the OS are not available on all versions of the OS in common use. Likewise,
functions are often deprecated or made obsolete for security reasons and should not be used.

Phase: Implementation
Always test your code on any platform on which it is targeted to run on.
Phase: T esting
Test your code on the newest and oldest platform on which it is targeted to run on.
Phase: T esting
Develop a system to test for API functions that are not portable.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
