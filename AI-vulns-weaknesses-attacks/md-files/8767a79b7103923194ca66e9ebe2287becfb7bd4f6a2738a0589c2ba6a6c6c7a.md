CWE-940: Improper V erification of Source of a Communication Channel
Weakness ID: 940
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor , but it does not
properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.
 Extended Description
When an attacker can successfully establish a communication channel from an untrusted origin, the attacker may be able to gain
privileges and access unexpected functionality .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/940.html 2/3This application does not check the origin of the intent, thus allowing any malicious application to remove a user . Always check the
origin of an intent, or create an allowlist of trusted applications using the manifest.xml file.
Example 2
These Android and iOS applications intercept URL loading within a W ebView and perform special actions if a particular URL scheme
is used, thus allowing the Javascript within the W ebView to communicate with the application:
A call into native code can then be initiated by passing parameters within the URL:
Because the application does not check the source, a malicious website loaded within this W ebView has the same access to the API
as a trusted site.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2000-1218 DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query , leading to cache poisoning
CVE-2005-0877 DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query , leading to cache poisoning
CVE-2001-1452 DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a mechanism that can validate the identity of the source, such as a certificate, and validate the integrity of data to ensure
that it cannot be modified in transit using an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack.
When designing functionality of actions in the URL scheme, consider whether the action should be accessible to all mobile
applications, or if an allowlist of applications to interface with is appropriate.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/940.html 3/3Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
While many access control issues involve authenticating the user , this weakness is more about authenticating the actual source of
the communication channel itself; there might not be any "user" in such cases.
