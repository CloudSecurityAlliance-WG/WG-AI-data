 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The usage of symbolic names instead of hard-coded constants is preferred.
The following is an example of using a hard-coded constant instead of a symbolic name.
If the buf fer value needs to be changed, then it has to be altered in more than one place. If the developer forgets or does not find all
occurrences, in this example it could lead to a buf fer overflow .
In this example the developer will only need to change one value and all references to the buf fer size are updated, as a symbolic
name is used instead of a hard-coded constant.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
Comments:
Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.
