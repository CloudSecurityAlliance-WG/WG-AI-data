 Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using thread synchronization primitives.
 Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure
that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container . In this case, the product violates the following EJB
guideline: "An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances." The
specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because
while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean's instances, others may distribute the instances
across multiple JVMs."

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/574.html 2/2However , the customer entity EJB uses the synchronized keyword for the set methods to attempt to provide thread safe
synchronization for the member variables. The use of synchronized methods violate the restriction of the EJB specification against the
use synchronization primitives within EJBs. Using synchronization primitives may cause inconsistent behavior of the EJB when used
within dif ferent EJB containers.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Do not use Synchronization Primitives when writing EJBs.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
