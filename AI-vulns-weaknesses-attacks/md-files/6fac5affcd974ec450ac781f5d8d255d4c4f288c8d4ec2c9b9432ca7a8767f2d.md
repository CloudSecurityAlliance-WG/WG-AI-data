CWE-395: Use of NullPointerException Catch to Detect NULL Pointer Dereference
Weakness ID: 395
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
Catching NullPointerException should not be used as an alternative to programmatic checks to prevent dereferencing a null pointer .
 Extended Description
Programmers typically catch NullPointerException under three circumstances:
The program contains a null pointer dereference. Catching the resulting exception was easier than fixing the underlying
problem.
The program explicitly throws a NullPointerException to signal an error condition.
The code is part of a test harness that supplies unexpected input to the classes under test.
Of these three circumstances, only the last is acceptable.

Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Do not extensively rely on catching exceptions (especially for validating user input) to handle errors. Handling exceptions can

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Bytecode W eakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis
Binary W eakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Framework-based Fuzzer
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Manual Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)
Effectiveness: SOAR Partial
Automated Static Analysis - Source Code
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Source code W eakness Analyzer
Context-configured Source Code W eakness Analyzer
Effectiveness: High
Architecture or Design Review
According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost ef fective:
Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction
Cost ef fective for partial coverage:
Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)
Effectiveness: High

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
