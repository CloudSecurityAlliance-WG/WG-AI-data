CWE-761: Free of Pointer not at Start of Buffer
Weakness ID: 761
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls free() on a pointer to a memory resource that was allocated on the heap, but the pointer is not at the start of the
buffer.
 Extended Description
This can cause the product to crash, or in some cases, modify critical program variables or execute code.
This weakness often occurs when the memory is allocated explicitly on the heap with one of the malloc() family functions and free() is
called, but pointer arithmetic has caused the pointer to be in the interior or end of the buf fer.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In this example, the programmer dynamically allocates a buf fer to hold a string and then searches for a specific character . After
completing the search, the programmer attempts to release the allocated memory and return SUCCESS or F AILURE to the caller .
Note: for simplification, this example uses a hard-coded "Search Me!" string and a constant string length of 20.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/761.html 2/4However , if the character is not at the beginning of the string, or if it is not in the string at all, then the pointer will not be at the start of
the buf fer when the programmer frees it.
Instead of freeing the pointer in the middle of the buf fer, the programmer can use an indexing pointer to step through the memory or
abstract the memory calculations by using array indexing.
Example 2
This code attempts to tokenize a string and place it into an array using the strsep function, which inserts a \0 byte in place of
whitespace or a tab character . After finishing the loop, each string in the AP array points to a location within the input string.
Since strsep is not allocating any new memory , freeing an element in the middle of the array is equivalent to free a pointer in the
middle of inputstring.
Example 3
Consider the following code in the context of a parsing application to extract commands out of user data. The intent is to parse each
command and add it to a queue of commands to be executed, discarding each malformed entry .}
(good code) Example Language: C 
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int cointains\_char(char c){
char \*str;
int i = 0;
str = (char\*)malloc(20\*sizeof(char));
strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
while( i < strlen(str) ){
if( str[i] == c ){
/\* matched char, free string and return success \*/
free(str);
return SUCCESS;
}
/\* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char \*/
i = i + 1;
}
/\* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure \*/
free(str);
return FAILURE;
}
(bad code) Example Language: C 
char \*\*ap, \*argv[10], \*inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (\*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t")) != NULL;)
if (\*\*ap != '\0')
if (++ap >= &argv[10])
break;
/.../
free(ap[4]);
(bad code) Example Language: C 
//hardcode input length for simplicity
char\* input = (char\*) malloc(40\*sizeof(char));
char \*tok;
char\* sep = " \t";
get\_user\_input( input );
/\* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string \*/
tok = strtok( input, sep);
while( NULL != tok ){
if( isMalformed( tok ) ){
/\* ignore and discard bad data \*/
free( tok );
}
else{
add\_to\_command\_queue( tok );
}
tok = strtok( NULL, sep));
}3/7/24, 3:09 PM CWE - CWE-761: Free of Pointer not at Start of Buﬀer (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/761.html 3/4While the above code attempts to free memory associated with bad commands, since the memory was all allocated in one chunk, it
must all be freed together .
One way to fix this problem would be to copy the commands into a new memory location before placing them in the queue. Then,
after all commands have been processed, the memory can safely be freed.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-11930 function "internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buf fer. This led
to freeing invalid memory ."
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
When utilizing pointer arithmetic to traverse a buf fer, use a separate variable to track progress through memory and preserve the
originally allocated address for later freeing.
Phase: Implementation
When programming in C++, consider using smart pointers provided by the boost library to help correctly and consistently
manage memory .
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks
Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness
easier to avoid.
For example, glibc in Linux provides protection against free of invalid pointers.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a language that provides abstractions for memory allocation and deallocation.
Phase: T esting
Use a tool that dynamically detects memory management problems, such as valgrind.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/761.html 4/4Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
Currently , CWE-763 is the parent, however it may be desirable to have an intermediate parent which is not function-specific, similar
to how CWE-762 is an intermediate parent between CWE-763 and CWE-590 .
