CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
Weakness ID: 302
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or
modified by the attacker .

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following example, an "authenticated" cookie is used to determine whether or not a user should be granted access to a system.
Modifying the value of a cookie on the client-side is trivial, but many developers assume that cookies are essentially immutable.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
