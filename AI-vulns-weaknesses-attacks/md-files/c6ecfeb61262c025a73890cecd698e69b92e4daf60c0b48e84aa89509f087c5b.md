 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2004-0462 A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could
cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.
CVE-2008-3663 A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the
cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
CVE-2008-3662 A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the
cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
CVE-2008-0128 A product does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to
be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Always set the secure attribute when the cookie should sent via HTTPS only .
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building aAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
