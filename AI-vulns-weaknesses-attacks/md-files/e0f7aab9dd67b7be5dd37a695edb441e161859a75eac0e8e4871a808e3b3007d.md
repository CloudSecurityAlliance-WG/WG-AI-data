 Description
A covert channel is a path that can be used to transfer information in a way not intended by the system's designers.
 Extended Description
Typically the system has not given authorization for the transmission and has no knowledge of its occurrence.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In this example, the attacker observes how long an authentication takes when the user types in the correct password.
When the attacker tries their own values, they can first try strings of various length. When they find a string of the right length, the
computation will take a bit longer , because the for loop will run at least once. Additionally , with this code, the attacker can possibly
learn one character of the password at a time, because when they guess the first character right, the computation will take longer than
a wrong guesses. Such an attack can break even the most sophisticated password with a few hundred guesses.
Note that in this example, the actual password must be handled in constant time as far as the attacker is concerned, even if the actual
password is of an unusual length. This is one reason why it is good to use an algorithm that, among other things, stores a seeded
cryptographic one-way hash of the password, then compare the hashes, which will always be of the same length.

Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

 Notes
Theoretical
A covert channel can be thought of as an emergent resource, meaning that it was not an originally intended resource, however it
exists due the application's behaviors.
Maintenance
As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses,
which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work,
this entry might change in CWE 4.10.
