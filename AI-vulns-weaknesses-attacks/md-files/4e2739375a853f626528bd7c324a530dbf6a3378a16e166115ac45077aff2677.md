Full ML Model Access 󰅂
Summary
Adversaries may gain full "white-box" access to a machine learning model. This
means the adversary has complete knowledge of the model architecture, its
parameters, and class ontology . They may exfiltrate the model to Craft Adversarial
Data and Verify Attack in an of fline where it is hard to detect their behavior .
