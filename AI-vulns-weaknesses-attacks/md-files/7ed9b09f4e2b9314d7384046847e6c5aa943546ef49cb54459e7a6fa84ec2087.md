Range
Weakness ID: 1044
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product's architecture contains too many - or too few - horizontal layers.
 Extended Description
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product, which indirectly af fects security by making it more dif ficult or time-consuming
to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
While the interpretation of "expected range" may vary for each product or developer , CISQ recommends a default minimum of 4
layers and maximum of 8 layers.
