CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax
Weakness ID: 644
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes web scripting syntax in HTTP headers that can be used by web browser
components that can process raw headers, such as Flash.
 Extended Description
An attacker may be able to conduct cross-site scripting and other attacks against users who have these components enabled.
If a product does not neutralize user controlled data being placed in the header of an HTTP response coming from the server , the
header may contain a script that will get executed in the client's browser context, potentially resulting in a cross site scripting
vulnerability or possibly an HTTP response splitting attack. It is important to carefully control data that is being placed both in HTTP
response header and in the HTTP response body to ensure that no scripting syntax is present, taking various encodings into account.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example, user-controlled data is added to the HTTP headers and returned to the client. Given that the data is not
subject to neutralization, a malicious user may be able to inject dangerous scripting tags that will lead to script execution in the client
browser .

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/644.html 2/2CVE-2006-3918 Web server does not remove the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an
error message, allowing a Flash SWF file to perform XSS attacks.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Perform output validation in order to filter/escape/encode unsafe data that is being passed from the server in an HTTP response
header .
Phase: Architecture and Design
Disable script execution functionality in the clients' browser .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
