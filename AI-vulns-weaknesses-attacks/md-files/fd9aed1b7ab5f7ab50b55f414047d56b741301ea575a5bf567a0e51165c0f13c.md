View customized information:
 Description
The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-managed code resources such as variables, objects,
classes, attributes, functions, or executable instructions or statements.
 Extended Description
Many languages of fer powerful features that allow the programmer to dynamically create or modify existing code, or resources used
by code such as variables and objects. While these features can of fer significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can be
extremely dangerous if attackers can directly influence these code resources in unexpected ways.

Reference Description
CVE-2022-2054 Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
CVE-2018-1000613 Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key
CVE-2015-8103 Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
CVE-2006-7079 Chain: extract used for register\_globals compatibility layer , enables path traversal ( CWE-22 )
CVE-2012-2055 Source version control product allows modification of trusted key using mass assignment.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
For any externally-influenced input, check the input against an allowlist of acceptable values.
Phases: Implementation; Architecture and Design
Strategy: Refactoring
Refactor the code so that it does not need to be dynamically managed.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/913.html 2/2Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
