CWE-685: Function Call W ith Incorrect Number of Arguments
Weakness ID: 685
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies too many arguments, or too few arguments, which may
lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 628 Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation This problem typically occurs when the programmer makes a typo, or copy and paste errors.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
C (Undetermined Prevalence)
Perl (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: T esting
Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the
product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the
incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected
argument type.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Other
While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the
called function accepts variable numbers of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or
environments that do not require that functions always be called with the correct number of arguments, such as Perl.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/685.html 2/2Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
