 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following code is a Java servlet that will receive a GET request with a url parameter in the request to redirect the browser to the
address specified in the url parameter . The servlet will retrieve the url parameter value from the request and send a response to
redirect the browser to the url address.
The problem with this Java servlet code is that an attacker could use the RedirectServlet as part of an e-mail phishing scam to
redirect users to a malicious site. An attacker could send an HTML formatted e-mail directing the user to log into their account by
including in the e-mail the following link:About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public class RedirectServlet extends HttpServlet {
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
String query = request.getQueryString();
if (query.contains("url")) {
String url = request.getParameter("url");

(attack code) Example Language: HTML 
[Click here to log in](http://bank.example.com/redirect?url=http://attacker.example.net)3/7/24, 3:05 PM CWE - CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/610.html 2/2The user may assume that the link is safe since the URL starts with their trusted bank, bank.example.com. However , the user will then
be redirected to the attacker's web site (attacker .example.net) which the attacker may have made to appear very similar to
bank.example.com. The user may then unwittingly enter credentials into the attacker's web page and compromise their bank account.
A Java servlet should never redirect a user to a URL without verifying that the redirect address is a trusted site.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
Comments:
Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
 Notes
Relationship
This is a general class of weakness, but most research is focused on more specialized cases, such as path traversal ( CWE-22 ) and
symlink following ( CWE-61 ). A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However , the link
includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions
that accept filenames will "follow" a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.
Maintenance
The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99
"Resource Injection," as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy , emphasizes the "identifier used to access a
system resource" such as a file name or port number , yet it explicitly states that the "resource injection" term does not apply to "path
manipulation," which ef fectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a
resource identifier . Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer , the
application layer , or the code layer .
