CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
Weakness ID: 300
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure
the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.
 Extended Description
In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at
each end of the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insuf ficient or incorrect identification of
either communicating entity . This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the
channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity . In
the absence of suf ficient verification of identity , such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between
the original entities.

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2014-1266 chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-
Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561
(Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate V alidation) -> CWE-393 (Return of W rong Status
Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Always fully authenticate both ends of any communications channel.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Adhere to the principle of complete mediation.
Phase: Implementation
A certificate binds an identity to a cryptographic key to authenticate a communicating party . Often, the certificate takes the
encrypted form of the hash of the identity of the subject, the public key , and information such as time of issue or expiration using
the issuer's private key . The certificate can be validated by deciphering the certificate with the issuer's public key . See also X.509
certificate signature chains and the PGP certification structure.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Frequent Misuse
Rationale:
CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a
privileged "in-the-middle" position.
Comments:
Consider root-cause weaknesses that allow adversary-in-the-middle attacks to happen, such as CWEs involving poor integrity
protection.
 Notes
Maintenance
The summary identifies multiple distinct possibilities, suggesting that this is a category that must be broken into more specific
weaknesses.
