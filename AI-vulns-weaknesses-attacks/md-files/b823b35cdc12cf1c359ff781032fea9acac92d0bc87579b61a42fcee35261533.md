CWE-1258: Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug
Information
Weakness ID: 1258
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when
debug mode is entered.
 Extended Description
Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic operations, etc. are stored in temporary registers in the hardware.
If these values are not cleared when debug mode is entered they may be accessed by a debugger allowing sensitive information to
be accessible by untrusted parties.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
A cryptographic core in a System-On-a-Chip (SoC) is used for cryptographic acceleration and implements several cryptographic
operations (e.g., computation of AES encryption and decryption, SHA-256, HMAC, etc.). The keys for these operations or the
intermediate values are stored in registers internal to the cryptographic core. These internal registers are in the Memory Mapped Input
Output (MMIO) space and are blocked from access by software and other untrusted agents on the SoC. These registers are
accessible through the debug and test interface.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

 Previous Entry Names
(bad code) Example Language: Other 
In the above scenario, registers that store keys and intermediate values of cryptographic operations are not cleared when system enters
debug mode. An untrusted actor running a debugger may read the contents of these registers and gain access to secret keys and other
sensitive cryptographic information.
(good code) Example Language: Other 
Whenever the chip enters debug mode, all registers containing security-sensitive data are be cleared rendering them unreadable.
