View customized information:
 Description
The product implements a security identifier mechanism to dif ferentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction
originates from an entity . A transaction is sent without a security identifier .
 Extended Description
In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes)
assets or perform certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute). A typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify the
originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity) in addition to much more
information in the message. Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a Security Identifier . This Security Identifier helps the
destination agent decide on the set of allowed or disallowed actions.
A weakness that can exist in such transaction schemes is that the source agent does not consistently include the necessary Security
Identifier with the transaction. If the Security Identifier is missing, the destination agent might drop the message (resulting in an
inadvertent Denial-of-Service (DoS)) or take inappropriate action by default in its attempt to execute the transaction, resulting in
privilege escalation or provision of unintended access.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/1302.html 2/3Consider a system with a register for storing AES key for encryption or decryption. The key is of 128 bits implemented as a set of four
32-bit registers. The key registers are assets, and the register AES\_KEY\_ACCESS\_POLICY is defined to provide the necessary
access controls.
The access-policy register defines which agents with a security identifier in the transaction can access the AES-key registers. Each bit
in this 32-bit register defines a security identifier . There could be a maximum of 32 security identifiers that are allowed accesses to the
AES-key registers. The number of the bit when set (i.e., "1") allows for a respective action from an agent whose identity matches the
number of the bit; if set to "0" (i.e., Clear), it disallows the respective action to that corresponding agent.
The originator sends a transaction with no security identifier , i.e., meaning the value is "0" or NULL. The AES-Key-access register
does not allow the necessary action and drops the transaction because the originator failed to include the required security identifier .
The originator should send a transaction with Security Identifier "2" which will allow access to the AES-Key-access register and allow
encryption and decryption operations.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Transaction details must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.
Phase: Implementation
Security identifier definition and programming flow must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
