 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java example the class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user input data
from a registration webpage for a online business site. The user will enter registration data and through the Struts framework the
RegistrationForm bean will maintain the user data.
However , within the RegistrationForm the member variables for the registration form input data are declared public not private. All
member variables within a Struts framework ActionForm class must be declared private to prevent the member variables from being
modified without using the getter and setter methods. The following example shows the member variables being declared private and
getter and setter methods declared for accessing the member variables.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Make all fields private. Use getter to get the value of the field. Setter should be used only by the framework; setting an action
form field from other actions is bad practice and should be avoided.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
