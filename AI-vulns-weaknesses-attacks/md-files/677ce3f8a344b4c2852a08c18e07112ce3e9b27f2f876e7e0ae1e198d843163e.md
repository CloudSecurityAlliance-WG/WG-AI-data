CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
Weakness ID: 838
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the
same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.
 Extended Description
This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces dif ferent data than what the product
intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data
incorrectly . This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken,
because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting
data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.
While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong
encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.
For example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However , a programmer might use entity
encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is
not af fected by the HTML encoding.
While web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product
that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings.

...3/7/24, 3:11 PM CWE - CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/838.html 2/3The programmer attempts to avoid XSS exploits ( CWE-79 ) by encoding the POST values so they will not be interpreted as valid
HTML. However , the htmlentities() encoding is not appropriate when the data are used as HTML attributes, allowing more attributes to
be injected.
For example, an attacker can set picAltT ext to:
This will result in the generated HTML image tag:
The attacker can inject arbitrary javascript into the tag due to this incorrect encoding.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2009-2814 Server does not properly handle requests that do not contain UTF-8 data; browser assumes UTF-8,
allowing XSS.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Output Encoding
Use context-aware encoding. That is, understand which encoding is being used by the downstream component, and ensure that
this encoding is used. If an encoding can be specified, do so, instead of assuming that the default encoding is the same as the
default being assumed by the downstream component.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Output Encoding
Where possible, use communications protocols or data formats that provide strict boundaries between control and data. If this is
not feasible, ensure that the protocols or formats allow the communicating components to explicitly state which
encoding/decoding method is being used. Some template frameworks provide built-in support.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks
Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness
easier to avoid.
For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [ REF-45 ] or a similar tool, library , or framework. These will help the
programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error .
Note that some template mechanisms provide built-in support for the appropriate encoding.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/838.html 3/3This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
