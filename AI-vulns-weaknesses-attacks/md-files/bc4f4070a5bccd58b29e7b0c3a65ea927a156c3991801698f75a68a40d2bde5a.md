Ordinality Description
Indirect(where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make
them more difficult to detect)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/475.html 2/2Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Other
The Linux Standard Base Specification 2.0.1 for libc places constraints on the arguments to some internal functions [21]. If the
constraints are not met, the behavior of the functions is not defined. It is unusual for this function to be called directly . It is almost
always invoked through a macro defined in a system header file, and the macro ensures that the following constraints are met: The
value 1 must be passed to the third parameter (the version number) of the following file system function: \_\_xmknod The value 2
must be passed to the third parameter (the group argument) of the following wide character string functions: \_\_wcstod\_internal
\_\_wcstof\_internal \_\_wcstol\_internal \_\_wcstold\_internal \_\_wcstoul\_internal The value 3 must be passed as the first parameter (the
version number) of the following file system functions: \_\_xstat \_\_lxstat \_\_fxstat \_\_xstat64 \_\_lxstat64 \_\_fxstat64
