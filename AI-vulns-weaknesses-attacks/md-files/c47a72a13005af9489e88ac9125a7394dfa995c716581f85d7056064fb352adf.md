CWE-688: Function Call W ith Incorrect V ariable or Reference as Argument
Weakness ID: 688
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the wrong variable or reference as one of the arguments,
which may lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
Nature Type ID Name
ChildOf 628 Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Implementation This problem typically occurs when the programmer makes a typo, or copy and paste errors.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
C (Undetermined Prevalence)
Perl (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
OtherTechnical Impact: Quality Degradation
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following Java snippet, the accessGranted() method is accidentally called with the static ADMIN\_ROLES array rather than the
user roles.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2005-2548 Kernel code specifies the wrong variable in first argument, leading to resultant NULL pointer
dereference.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: T esting
Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the
product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when theAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Other
While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the
called function accepts variable numbers of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in loosely typed languages
or environments. This might require an understanding of intended program behavior or design to determine whether the value is
incorrect.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
