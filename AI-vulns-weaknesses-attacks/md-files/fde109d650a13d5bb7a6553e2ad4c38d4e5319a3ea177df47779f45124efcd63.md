CWE-575: EJB Bad Practices: Use of AWT Swing

View customized information:
 Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using AWT/Swing.
 Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure
that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container . In this case, the product violates the following EJB
guideline: "An enterprise bean must not use the AWT functionality to attempt to output information to a display , or to input information
from a keyboard." The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "Most servers do not allow direct interaction
between an application program and a keyboard/display attached to the server system."

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following Java example is a simple converter class for converting US dollars to Yen. This converter class demonstrates the
improper practice of using a stateless session Enterprise JavaBean that implements an AWT Component and AWT keyboard event
listener to retrieve keyboard input from the user for the amount of the US dollars to convert to Yen.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

bliBiDildllTY(BiDildll){3/7/24, 3:04 PM CWE - CWE-575: EJB Bad Practices: Use of AWT Swing (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/575.html 2/3This use of the AWT and Swing APIs within any kind of Enterprise JavaBean not only violates the restriction of the EJB specification
against using AWT or Swing within an EJB but also violates the intended use of Enterprise JavaBeans to separate business logic from
presentation logic.
The Stateless Session Enterprise JavaBean should contain only business logic. Presentation logic should be provided by some other
mechanism such as Servlets or Java Server Pages (JSP) as in the following Java/JSP example.public BigDecimal dollarToYen(BigDecimal dollars) {
BigDecimal result = dollars.multiply(yenRate);
return result.setScale(2, BigDecimal.ROUND\_DOWN);
}
/\* member functions for implementing AWT KeyListener interface \*/
public void keyTyped(KeyEvent event) {
...
}
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
}
public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
}
/\* member functions for receiving keyboard input and displaying output \*/
public void paint(Graphics g) {...}
...
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 
@Stateless
public class ConverterSessionBean implements ConverterSessionRemoteInterface {
/\* conversion rate on US dollars to Yen \*/
private BigDecimal yenRate = new BigDecimal("115.3100");
public ConverterSessionBean() {
}
/\* remote method to convert US dollars to Yen \*/
public BigDecimal dollarToYen(BigDecimal dollars) {
BigDecimal result = dollars.multiply(yenRate);
return result.setScale(2, BigDecimal.ROUND\_DOWN);
}
}
(good code) Example Language: JSP 
<%@ page import="converter.ejb.Converter, java.math.\*, javax.naming.\*"%>
<%!
private Converter converter = null;
public void jspInit() {
try {
InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
converter = (Converter) ic.lookup(Converter.class.getName());
} catch (Exception ex) {
System.out.println("Couldn't create converter bean."+ ex.getMessage());
}
}
public void jspDestroy() {
converter = null;

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
