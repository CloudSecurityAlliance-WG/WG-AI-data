CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
Weakness ID: 552
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.
 Extended Description
Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a "root" directory that is accessible to the server's
users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request
those files, if any . Alternately , an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the
application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.
In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be
read or written by a public or anonymous user .

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following Azure command updates the settings for a storage account:
However , "Allow Blob Public Access" is set to true, meaning that anonymous/public users can access blobs.
The command could be modified to disable "Allow Blob Public Access" by setting it to false.
Example 2
The following Google Cloud Storage command gets the settings for a storage account named 'BUCKET\_NAME':
Suppose the command returns the following result:
This result includes the "allUsers" or IAM role added as members, causing this policy configuration to allow public access to cloud
storage resources. There would be a similar concern if "allAuthenticatedUsers" was present.
The command could be modified to remove "allUsers" and/or "allAuthenticatedUsers" as follows:
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2005-1835 Data file under web root.
 Potential Mitigations
Phases: Implementation; System Configuration; Operation
When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to disable
public access.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)
Effectiveness: High(bad code) Example Language: Shell 
az storage account update --name  --resource-group  --allow-blob-public-access true
(good code) Example Language: Shell 
az storage account update --name  --resource-group  --allow-blob-public-access false
(informative) Example Language: Shell 
gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET\_NAME
(bad code) Example Language: JSON 
{
"bindings":[{
"members":[
"projectEditor: PROJECT-ID",
"projectOwner: PROJECT-ID"
],
"role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner"
},
{
"members":[
"allUsers",
"projectViewer: PROJECT-ID"
],
"role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketReader"
}
]
}
(good code) Example Language: Shell 
gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET\_NAME
gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET\_NAME3/7/24, 3:03 PM CWE - CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties (4.14)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
