CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Weakness ID: 664
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.
 Extended Description
Resources often have explicit instructions on how to be created, used and destroyed. When code does not follow these instructions, it
can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially exploitable states.
Even without explicit instructions, various principles are expected to be adhered to, such as "Do not use an object until after its
creation is complete," or "do not use an object after it has been slated for destruction."

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Abstraction
Rationale:
This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.
Comments:
Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
 Notes
Maintenance
More work is needed on this entry and its children. There are perspective/layering issues; for example, one breakdown is based on
lifecycle phase ( CWE-404 , CWE-665 ), while other children are independent of lifecycle, such as CWE-400 . Others do not specify as
many bases or variants, such as CWE-704 , which primarily covers numbers at this stage.
