CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for V olatile Memory Containing Boot Code
Weakness ID: 1274
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-V olatile Memory (NVM) into V olatile Memory
(VM), but it does not have suf ficient access control or other protections for the V olatile Memory .
 Extended Description
Adversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their own untrusted, malicious boot code.
As a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches
bootloader code from Non-V olatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in V olatile Memory (VM), such as dynamic, random-access
memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM). The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the
SoC. As the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code.
If the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insuf ficient to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted
agent, the secure boot may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
A typical SoC secure boot's flow includes fetching the next piece of code (i.e., the boot loader) from NVM (e.g., serial, peripheral
interface (SPI) flash), and transferring it to DRAM/SRAM volatile, internal memory , which is more ef ficient.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2019-2267 Locked memory regions may be modified through other interfaces in a secure-boot-loader image due
to improper access control.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Ensure that the design of volatile-memory protections is enough to prevent modification from an adversary or untrusted code.
Phase: T esting
Test the volatile-memory protections to ensure they are safe from modification or untrusted code.
 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Manual Analysis
Ensure the volatile memory is lockable or has locks. Ensure the volatile memory is locked for writes from untrusted agents or
adversaries. Try modifying the volatile memory from an untrusted agent, and ensure these writes are dropped.
Effectiveness: High
Manual Analysis
Analyze the device using the following steps:
1. Identify all fabric master agents that are active during system Boot Flow when initial code is loaded from Non-volatile
storage to volatile memory .
2. Identify the volatile memory regions that are used for storing loaded system executable program.
3. During system boot, test programming the identified memory regions in step 2 from all the masters identified in step 1.
Only trusted masters should be allowed to write to the memory regions. For example, pluggable device peripherals should not
have write access to program load memory regions.
Effectiveness: Moderate

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

 Content History
(good code) 
A good architecture should define appropriate protections or access controls to prevent modification by an adversary or untrusted agent,
once the bootloader is authenticated.3/7/24, 2:47 PM CWE - CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code (4.14)
