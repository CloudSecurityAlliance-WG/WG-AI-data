CWE-1391: Use of W eak Credentials
Weakness ID: 1391
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or
guessed by an attacker .
 Extended Description
By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials
such as a key or password. However , when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded
passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.
Credentials may be weak for dif ferent reasons, such as:
Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)
Default (i.e., the same static value across dif ferent deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)
Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be
guessed with reasonable ef ficiency)
Even if a new , unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that
may also simplify guessing attacks.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In 2022, the OT :ICEF ALL study examined products by 10 dif ferent Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56
vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [ REF-1283 ]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed
adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed.
Since these products were often used in industries such as power , electrical, water , and others, there could even be safety
implications.

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function
instead of reporting a failure ( CWE-392 ), thus reducing the entropy ( CWE-332 ) and leading to
generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets ( CWE-1391 )
CVE-2022-30270 Remote Terminal Unit (R TU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts
CVE-2022-29965 Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords
CVE-2022-30271 Remote Terminal Unit (R TU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical
deployments
CVE-2021-38759 microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access
CVE-2021-41192 data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in
environment variables
CVE-2020-8994 UAR T interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell
CVE-2020-27020 password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of
passwords using guessable details such as time of generation
CVE-2020-8632 password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force
guessing
CVE-2020-5365 network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support
account
CVE-2020-5248 IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations
CVE-2012-3503 Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication
CVE-2010-2306 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and
installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic
CVE-2001-0618 Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key,
which allows attackers to get the key by snif fing the SSID, which is sent in the clear
