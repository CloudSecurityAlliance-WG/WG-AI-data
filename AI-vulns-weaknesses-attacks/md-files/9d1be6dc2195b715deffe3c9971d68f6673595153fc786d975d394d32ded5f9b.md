 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Integrity
OtherTechnical Impact: Varies by Context; Unexpected State
Errors that are not properly reported could place the system in an unexpected state that could lead to
unintended behaviors.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following snippet from a doPost() servlet method, the server returns "200 OK" (default) even if an error occurs.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function
instead of reporting a failure ( CWE-392 ), thus reducing the entropy ( CWE-332 ) and leading to
generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets ( CWE-1391 )About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
