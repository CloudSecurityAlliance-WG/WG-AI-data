View customized information:
 Description
A product acts as an intermediary or monitor between two or more endpoints, but it does not have a complete model of an endpoint's
features, behaviors, or state, potentially causing the product to perform incorrect actions based on this incomplete model.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
HTTP request smuggling is an attack against an intermediary such as a proxy . This attack works because the proxy expects the client
to parse HTTP headers one way , but the client parses them dif ferently .
Example 2
Anti-virus products that reside on mail servers can suf fer from this issue if they do not know how a mail client will handle a particular
attachment. The product might treat an attachment type as safe, not knowing that the client's configuration treats it as executable.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/437.html 2/2Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
This can be related to interaction errors, although in some cases, one of the endpoints is not performing correctly according to
specification.
