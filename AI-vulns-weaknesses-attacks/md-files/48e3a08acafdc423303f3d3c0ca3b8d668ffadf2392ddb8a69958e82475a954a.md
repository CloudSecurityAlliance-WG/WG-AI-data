CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
Weakness ID: 1188
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator , but the default is not
secure.
 Extended Description
Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the
assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However , this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the
default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This code attempts to login a user using credentials from a POST request:
Because the $authorized variable is never initialized, PHP will automatically set $authorized to any value included in the POST
request if register\_globals is enabled. An attacker can send a POST request with an unexpected third value 'authorized' set to 'true'
and gain authorized status without supplying valid credentials.
Here is a fixed version:
This code avoids the issue by initializing the $authorized variable to false and explicitly retrieving the login credentials from the
$\_POST variable. Regardless, register\_globals should never be enabled and is disabled by default in current versions of PHP .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover "Missing" and "Incorrect"
behaviors. Arguably , this entry could be named as "Incorrect" instead of "Insecure." This might be changed in the near future.
