 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In this example, depending on the return value of accecssmainframe(), the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is
returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value, amount will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number .
If the return value of accessmainframe() is -1, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit
integers.
Example 2
The following code uses a union to support the representation of dif ferent types of messages. It formats messages dif ferently ,
depending on their type.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/704.html 2/3The code intends to process the message as a NAME\_TYPE, and sets the default message to "Hello W orld." However , since both
buf.name and buf.nameID are part of the same union, they can act as aliases for the same memory location, depending on memory
layout after compilation.
As a result, modification of buf.nameID - an int - can ef fectively modify the pointer that is stored in buf.name - a string.
Execution of the program might generate output such as:
Pointer of name is 10830
Pointer of name is now 10831
Message: ello W orld
Notice how the pointer for buf.name was changed, even though buf.name was not explicitly modified.
In this case, the first "H" character of the message is omitted. However , if an attacker is able to fully control the value of buf.nameID,
then buf.name could contain an arbitrary pointer , leading to out-of-bounds reads or writes.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2021-43537 Chain: in a web browser , an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer ( CWE-681 ) and
potentially leading to an integer overflow ( CWE-190 ). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap
memory corruption ( CWE-122 )
CVE-2022-3979 Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the "!=" operator instead of the type-strict "!=="
operator ( CWE-480 ) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion
(CWE-704 )
 Detection Methods
Fuzzing
Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
