View customized information:
 Description
The product generates and uses a predictable initialization V ector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, which causes
algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks when they are encrypted under the same key .
 Extended Description
CBC mode eliminates a weakness of Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode by allowing identical plaintext blocks to be encrypted to
different ciphertext blocks. This is possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext block so that every plaintext block in the
chain is XOR'd with a dif ferent value before encryption. If IVs are reused, then identical plaintexts would be encrypted to identical
ciphertexts. However , even if IVs are not identical but are predictable, then they still break the security of CBC mode against Chosen
Plaintext Attacks (CP A).

 Background Details
CBC mode is a commonly used mode of operation for a block cipher . It works by XOR-ing an IV with the initial block of a plaintext
prior to encryption and then XOR-ing each successive block of plaintext with the previous block of ciphertext before encryption.
C\_0 = IV
C\_i = E\_k{M\_i XOR C\_{i-1}}
When used properly , CBC mode provides security against chosen plaintext attacks. Having an unpredictable IV is a crucial
underpinning of this. See [ REF-1171 ].
 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
ImplementationDevelopers might dismiss the importance of an unpredictable IV and choose an easier implementation to save
effort, weakening the scheme in the process.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/329.html 2/3In both of these examples, the initialization vector (IV) is always a block of zeros. This makes the resulting cipher text much more
predictable and susceptible to a dictionary attack.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2020-5408 encryption functionality in an authentication framework uses a fixed null IV with CBC mode, allowing
attackers to decrypt traf fic in applications that use this functionality
CVE-2017-17704 messages for a door-unlocking product use a fixed IV in CBC mode, which is the same after each
restart
CVE-2017-11133 application uses AES in CBC mode, but the pseudo-random secret and IV are generated using
math.random, which is not cryptographically strong.
CVE-2007-3528 Blowfish-CBC implementation constructs an IV where each byte is calculated modulo 8 instead of
modulo 256, resulting in less than 12 bits for the ef fective IV length, and less than 4096 possible IV
values.
CVE-2011-3389 BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random,
allowing decryption of HTTPS traf fic using a chosen plaintext attack.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
NIST recommends two methods of generating unpredictable IVs for CBC mode [ REF-1172 ]. The first is to generate the IV
randomly . The second method is to encrypt a nonce with the same key and cipher to be used to encrypt the plaintext. In this
case the nonce must be unique but can be predictable, since the block cipher will act as a pseudo random permutation.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/329.html 3/3Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Maintenance
As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy , and predictability can vary widely . Within the developer and other
communities, "randomness" is used heavily . However , within cryptography , "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement.
There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will
attempt to define these terms and, if necessary , distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for dif ferent communities but
do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.
