AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Unexpected State; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)
If an input is syntactically invalid, then processing the input could place the system in an unexpected
state that could lead to a crash, consume available system resources or other unintended behaviors.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This Android application has registered to handle a URL when sent an intent:
The application assumes the URL will always be included in the intent. When the URL is not present, the call to getStringExtra() will
return null, thus causing a null pointer exception when length() is called.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Notes
Theoretical
The validity of input could be roughly classified along "syntactic", "semantic", and "lexical" dimensions. If the specification requires
that an input value should be delimited with the "[" and "]" square brackets, then any input that does not follow this specification
would be syntactically invalid. If the input between the brackets is expected to be a number , but the letters "aaa" are provided, then
the input is syntactically invalid. If the input is a number and enclosed in brackets, but the number is outside of the allowable range,
then it is semantically invalid. The inter-relationships between these properties - and their associated weaknesses- need further
exploration.
Maintenance
This entry needs more investigation. Public vulnerability research generally focuses on the manipulations that generate invalid
structure, instead of the weaknesses that are exploited by those manipulations. For example, a common attack involves making a
request that omits a required field, which can trigger a crash in some cases. The crash could be due to a named chain such as
CWE-690 (Unchecked Return V alue to NULL Pointer Dereference), but public reports rarely cover this aspect of a vulnerability .
