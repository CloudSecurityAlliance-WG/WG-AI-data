Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Application Data
The error message may contain the location of the file in which the of fending function is located. This
may disclose the web root's absolute path as well as give the attacker the location of application files
or configuration information. It may even disclose the portion of code that failed. In many cases, an
attacker can use the data to launch further attacks against the system.
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following servlet code does not catch runtime exceptions, meaning that if such an exception were to occur , the container may
display potentially dangerous information (such as a full stack trace).

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
