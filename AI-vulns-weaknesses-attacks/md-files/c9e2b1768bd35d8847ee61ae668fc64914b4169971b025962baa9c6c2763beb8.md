CWE-500: Public Static Field Not Marked Final
Weakness ID: 500
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
An object contains a public static field that is not marked final, which might allow it to be modified in unexpected ways.
 Extended Description
Public static variables can be read without an accessor and changed without a mutator by any classes in the application.
 Relationships
 Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)

 Background Details
When a field is declared public but not final, the field can be read and written to by arbitrary Java code.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/500.html 2/3Having a public static variable that is not marked final (constant) may allow the variable to the altered in a way not intended by the
application. In this example the String variable can be modified to indicate a dif ferent on nonexistent properties file which could cause
the application to crash or caused unexpected behavior .
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Clearly identify the scope for all critical data elements, including whether they should be regarded as static.
Phase: Implementation
Make any static fields private and constant.
A constant field is denoted by the keyword 'const' in C/C++ and ' final' in Java
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
