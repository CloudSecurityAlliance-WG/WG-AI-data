CWE-314: Cleartext Storage in the Registry
Weakness ID: 314
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in the registry .
 Extended Description
Attackers can read the information by accessing the registry key . Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-
readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

3/7/24, 2:56 PM CWE - CWE-314: Cleartext Storage in the Registry (4.14)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/314.html 2/2Terminology
Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However , within cryptography , these
have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-
encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-
readable (such as base64 encoding).
