CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query
('LDAP Injection')
Weakness ID: 90
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not
neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream
component.

Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Confidentiality
Integrity
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; Read Application Data; Modify Application Data
An attacker could include input that changes the LDAP query which allows unintended commands or
code to be executed, allows sensitive data to be read or modified or causes other unintended
behavior .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The code below constructs an LDAP query using user input address data:
Because the code fails to neutralize the address string used to construct the query , an attacker can supply an address that includes
additional LDAP queries.

possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Implementation
Strategy: Input V alidation
Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy , i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that
strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something
that does.
When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of
acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an
example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not
valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."
Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input,
especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However ,
denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected
outright.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Relationship
Factors: resultant to special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. Can be primary to authentication and
verification errors.
