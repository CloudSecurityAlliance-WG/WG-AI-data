Weakness ID: 1072
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product accesses a data resource through a database without using a connection pooling capability .
 Extended Description
This issue can make the product perform more slowly , as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead and
time consumption of opening and closing a new connection. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this performance
problem might introduce a vulnerability .
