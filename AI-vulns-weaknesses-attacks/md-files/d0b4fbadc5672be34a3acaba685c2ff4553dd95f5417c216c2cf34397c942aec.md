CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File
Weakness ID: 646
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors.
This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.
 Extended Description
An application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting
the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be
allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur . For example, an
attacker could supply a file that ends in a ".php.gif" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code.
In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure
of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may
be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from
another flaw in the application itself.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
