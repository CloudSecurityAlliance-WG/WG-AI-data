Integrity
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Modify Application Data; Read Application Data
If a released resource is subsequently reused or reallocated, then an attempt to use the original
resource might allow access to sensitive data that is associated with a dif ferent user or entity .

AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Other; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
When a resource is released it might not be in an expected state, later attempts to access the
resource may lead to resultant errors that may lead to a crash.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/672.html 2/3When an error occurs, the pointer is immediately freed. However , this pointer is later incorrectly used in the logError function.
Example 2
The following code shows a simple example of a double free error:
Double free vulnerabilities have two common (and sometimes overlapping) causes:
Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances
Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory
Although some double free vulnerabilities are not much more complicated than the previous example, most are spread out across
hundreds of lines of code or even dif ferent files. Programmers seem particularly susceptible to freeing global variables more than
once.
Example 3
In the following C/C++ example the method processMessage is used to process a message received in the input array of char arrays.
The input message array contains two char arrays: the first is the length of the message and the second is the body of the message.
The length of the message is retrieved and used to allocate enough memory for a local char array , messageBody , to be created for
the message body . The messageBody is processed in the method processMessageBody that will return an error if an error occurs
while processing. If an error occurs then the return result variable is set to indicate an error and the messageBody char array memory
is released using the method free and an error message is sent to the logError method.
However , the call to the method logError includes the messageBody after the memory for messageBody has been released using the
free method. This can cause unexpected results and may lead to system crashes. A variable should never be used after its memory
resources have been released.}
