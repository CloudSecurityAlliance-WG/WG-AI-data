CWE-245: J2EE Bad Practices: Direct Management of Connections
Weakness ID: 245
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The J2EE application directly manages connections, instead of using the container's connection management facilities.
 Extended Description
The J2EE standard forbids the direct management of connections. It requires that applications use the container's resource
management facilities to obtain connections to resources. Every major web application container provides pooled database
connection management as part of its resource management framework. Duplicating this functionality in an application is dif ficult and
error prone, which is part of the reason it is forbidden under the J2EE standard.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
In the following example, the class DatabaseConnection opens and manages a connection to a database for a J2EE application. The
method openDatabaseConnection opens a connection to the database using a DriverManager to create the Connection object conn
to the database specified in the string constant CONNECT\_STRING.
The use of the DriverManager class to directly manage the connection to the database violates the J2EE restriction against the direct
management of connections. The J2EE application should use the web application container's resource management facilities to
obtain a connection to the database as shown in the following example.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

 Weakness Ordinalities
Ordinality Description
Primary(where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
