 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This Android application has registered to handle a URL when sent an intent:
The application assumes the URL will always be included in the intent. When the URL is not present, the call to getStringExtra() will
return null, thus causing a null pointer exception when length() is called.

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the V ariant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
 Notes
Research Gap
Some "crash by port scan" bugs are probably due to this, but lack of diagnosis makes it dif ficult to be certain.
