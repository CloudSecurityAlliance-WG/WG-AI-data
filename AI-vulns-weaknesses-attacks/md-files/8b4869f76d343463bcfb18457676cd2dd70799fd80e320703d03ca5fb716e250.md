CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Weakness ID: 326
Vulnerability Mapping: (with careful review of mapping notes)
View customized information:
 Description
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the
level of protection required.
 Extended Description
A weak encryption scheme can be subjected to brute force attacks that have a reasonable chance of succeeding using current attack
methods and resources.

 Modes Of Introduction
Phase Note
Architecture and Design COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.
 Applicable Platforms
Languages
Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)
 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
Access Control
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Read Application Data
An attacker may be able to decrypt the data using brute force attacks.
 Observed Examples
Reference Description

CVE-2002-1975 Encryption error uses fixed salt, simplifying brute force / dictionary attacks (overlaps randomness).
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use an encryption scheme that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building aAbout ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼
