CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
Weakness ID: 413
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.
 Extended Description
When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might
violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
The following function attempts to acquire a lock in order to perform operations on a shared resource.
However , the code does not check the value returned by pthread\_mutex\_lock() for errors. If pthread\_mutex\_lock() cannot acquire the
mutex for any reason, the function may introduce a race condition into the program and result in undefined behavior .
In order to avoid data races, correctly written programs must check the result of thread synchronization functions and appropriately
handle all errors, either by attempting to recover from them or reporting them to higher levels.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/413.html 2/4Example 2
This Java example shows a simple BankAccount class with deposit and withdraw methods.
However , the deposit and withdraw methods have shared access to the account balance private class variable. This can result in a
race condition if multiple threads attempt to call the deposit and withdraw methods simultaneously where the account balance is
modified by one thread before another thread has completed modifying the account balance. For example, if a thread attempts to
withdraw funds using the withdraw method before another thread that is depositing funds using the deposit method completes the
deposit then there may not be suf ficient funds for the withdraw transaction.
To prevent multiple threads from having simultaneous access to the account balance variable the deposit and withdraw methods
should be synchronized using the synchronized modifier .
An alternative solution is to use a lock object to ensure exclusive access to the bank account balance variable. As shown below , the
deposit and withdraw methods use the lock object to set a lock to block access to the BankAccount object from other threads until the
method has completed updating the bank account balance variable.int f(pthread\_mutex\_t \*mutex) {
int result;
result = pthread\_mutex\_lock(mutex);
if (0 != result)
return result;
/\* access shared resource \*/
return pthread\_mutex\_unlock(mutex);
}
(bad code) Example Language: Java 
public class BankAccount {
// variable for bank account balance
private double accountBalance;
// constructor for BankAccount
public BankAccount() {
accountBalance = 0;
}
// method to deposit amount into BankAccount
public void deposit(double depositAmount) {
double newBalance = accountBalance + depositAmount;
accountBalance = newBalance;
}
// method to withdraw amount from BankAccount
public void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {
double newBalance = accountBalance - withdrawAmount;
accountBalance = newBalance;
}
// other methods for accessing the BankAccount object
...
}
(good code) Example Language: Java 
public class BankAccount {
...
// synchronized method to deposit amount into BankAccount
public synchronized void deposit(double depositAmount) {
...
}
// synchronized method to withdraw amount from BankAccount
public synchronized void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {
...
}
...

 Observed Examples
Reference Description
CVE-2022-20141 Chain: an operating system kernel has insuf ficent resource locking ( CWE-413 ) leading to a use after
free ( CWE-416 ).
 Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a non-conflicting privilege scheme.
Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation
Use synchronization when locking a resource.
 Detection Methods
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: ALLOWED (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Acceptable-Use
Rationale:
This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
vulnerabilities.
Comments:
Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a
lower-level Base/V ariant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
