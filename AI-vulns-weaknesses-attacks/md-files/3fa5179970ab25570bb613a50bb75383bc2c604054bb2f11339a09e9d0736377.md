CWE-1047: Modules with Circular Dependencies
Weakness ID: 1047
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product contains modules in which one module has references that cycle back to itself, i.e., there are circular dependencies.
 Extended Description
As an example, with Java, this weakness might indicate cycles between packages.
This issue makes it more dif ficult to maintain the product due to insuf ficient modularity , which indirectly af fects security by making it
more dif ficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably . If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker , then this reliability problem
might introduce a vulnerability .

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: PROHIBITED (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reason: Other
Rationale:
This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
Comments:
Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.
