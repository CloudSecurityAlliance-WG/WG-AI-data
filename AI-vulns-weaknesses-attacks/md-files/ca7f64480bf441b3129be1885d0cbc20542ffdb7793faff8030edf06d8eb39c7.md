CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
Weakness ID: 788
Vulnerability Mapping: 
View customized information:
 Description
The product reads or writes to a buf fer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buf fer.
 Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is incremented to a position after the buf fer; or when pointer arithmetic results in a
position after the buf fer.

 Common Consequences
Scope Impact Likelihood
ConfidentialityTechnical Impact: Read Memory
For an out-of-bounds read, the attacker may have access to sensitive information. If the sensitive
information contains system details, such as the current buf fers position in memory , this knowledge
can be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.
Integrity
AvailabilityTechnical Impact: Modify Memory; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory , and
perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are
possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.
IntegrityTechnical Impact: Modify Memory; Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
If the memory accessible by the attacker can be ef fectively controlled, it may be possible to execute
arbitrary code, as with a standard buf fer overflow . If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of
memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even
when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible.
Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same ef fect. Other
times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a
flag indicating whether the user is an administrator .
 Demonstrative Examples
Example 1
This example takes an IP address from a user , verifies that it is well formed and then looks up the hostname and copies it into a
buffer.About ▼ CWE List ▼ Mapping ▼ Top-N Lists ▼ Community ▼ News ▼

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/788.html 2/4This function allocates a buf fer of 64 bytes to store the hostname, however there is no guarantee that the hostname will not be larger
than 64 bytes. If an attacker specifies an address which resolves to a very large hostname, then the function may overwrite sensitive
data or even relinquish control flow to the attacker .
Note that this example also contains an unchecked return value ( CWE-252 ) that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference ( CWE-476 ).
Example 2
In the following example, it is possible to request that memcpy move a much larger segment of memory than assumed:
If returnChunkSize() happens to encounter an error it will return -1. Notice that the return value is not checked before the memcpy
operation ( CWE-252 ), so -1 can be passed as the size argument to memcpy() ( CWE-805 ). Because memcpy() assumes that the
value is unsigned, it will be interpreted as MAXINT -1 (CWE-195 ), and therefore will copy far more memory than is likely available to
the destination buf fer (CWE-787 , CWE-788 ).
Example 3
This example applies an encoding procedure to an input string and stores it into a buf fer.
The programmer attempts to encode the ampersand character in the user-controlled string, however the length of the string is
validated before the encoding procedure is applied. Furthermore, the programmer assumes encoding expansion will only expand a
given character by a factor of 4, while the encoding of the ampersand expands by 5. As a result, when the encoding procedure
expands the string it is possible to overflow the destination buf fer if the attacker provides a string of many ampersands.
Example 4
In the following C/C++ example the method processMessageFromSocket() will get a message from a socket, placed into a buf fer, and
will parse the contents of the buf fer into a structure that contains the message length and the message body . A for loop is used to
copy the message body into a local character string which will be passed to another method for processing.in\_addr\_t inet\_addr(const char \*cp);
/\*routine that ensures user\_supplied\_addr is in the right format for conversion \*/
validate\_addr\_form(user\_supplied\_addr);
addr = inet\_addr(user\_supplied\_addr);
hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in\_addr), AF\_INET);
strcpy(hostname, hp->h\_name);
}

int returnChunkSize(void \*) {
/\* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
\* else, return -1 to indicate an error
\*/
...
}
int main() {
...
memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));
...
}

char \* copy\_input(char \*user\_supplied\_string){
int i, dst\_index;
char \*dst\_buf = (char\*)malloc(4\*sizeof(char) \* MAX\_SIZE);
if ( MAX\_SIZE <= strlen(user\_supplied\_string) ){

dst\_buf[dst\_index++] = 'm';
dst\_buf[dst\_index++] = 'p';
dst\_buf[dst\_index++] = ';';

/\* encode to < \*/
}
else dst\_buf[dst\_index++] = user\_supplied\_string[i];

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/788.html 3/4However , the message length variable from the structure is used as the condition for ending the for loop without validating that the
message length variable accurately reflects the length of the message body ( CWE-606 ). This can result in a buf fer over-read ( CWE-
125) by reading from memory beyond the bounds of the buf fer if the message length variable indicates a length that is longer than the
size of a message body ( CWE-130 ).

 Detection Methods
Fuzzing
Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically
- and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected
results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing ef fectively produces repeatable test cases that
clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.
Effectiveness: High
Automated Static Analysis
Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically , this is done by building a
model of data flow and control flow , then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input)
with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Vulnerability Mapping Notes
Usage: DISCOURAGED (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Reasons: Potential Deprecation, Frequent Misuse
Rationale:
(bad code) Example Language: C 
int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
int success;
char buffer[BUFFER\_SIZE];
char message[MESSAGE\_SIZE];
// get message from socket and store into buffer
//Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER\_SIZE
if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER\_SIZE) > 0) {
// place contents of the buffer into message structure
ExMessage \*msg = recastBuffer(buffer);
// copy message body into string for processing
int index;
for (index = 0; index < msg->msgLength; index++) {
message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];
}
message[index] = '\0';
// process message
success = processMessage(message);
}
return success;

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/deﬁnitions/788.html 4/4The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and
might be deprecated in the future.
Comments:
If the "Access" operation is known to be a read or a write, then investigate children of entries such as CWE-787 : Out-of-bounds
Write and CWE-125 : Out-of-bounds Read.
