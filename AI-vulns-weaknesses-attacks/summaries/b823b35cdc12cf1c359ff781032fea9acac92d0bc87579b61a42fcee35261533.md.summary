# Summary

The document describes CWE-1258, a weakness where hardware fails to fully clear security-sensitive data like keys or intermediate cryptographic operation values when debug mode is entered. This exposes the sensitive information to attackers who can access it via debuggers. It provides background on the issue and an example involving a cryptographic core in a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) that stores keys and intermediate crypto values in internal registers accessible through the debug interface. The registers are not cleared when debug mode is entered, allowing attackers running debuggers to access the sensitive data. A potential mitigation is clearing all registers with sensitive assets whenever debug mode is enabled.
