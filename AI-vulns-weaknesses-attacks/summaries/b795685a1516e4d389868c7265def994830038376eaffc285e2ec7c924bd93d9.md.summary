Message:  # Summary

The weakness described is related to the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in a multi-threaded environment without proper synchronization. Specifically, it points out that if the singleton instance creation is not properly synchronized across threads, it can lead to issues like deadlock or livelock. This can reduce reliability of the software system. If the vulnerable code is reachable by an attacker, it could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service.

The key points are:

- Lack of synchronization when implementing the Singleton pattern in a multi-threaded environment
- Can lead to deadlock, livelock or other concurrency issues
- Reduces reliability of the system
- Potential for denial of service if reachable by an attacker

# Summary bullet points

* Describes weakness related to improper implementation of Singleton design pattern
* Fails to use appropriate locking/synchronization when instantiating Singleton
* Can make process non-thread-safe 
* Introduces risk of deadlock or livelock
* Reduces system reliability
* Could enable denial of service attack if reachable by attacker
