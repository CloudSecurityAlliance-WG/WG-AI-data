Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-651, a weakness related to the exposure of WSDL files containing sensitive information. WSDL files are used in web services architectures to provide information on publicly accessible services. If such a file is accessible to unintended parties, contains information on methods that should not be public, or helps attackers guess the names/locations of non-public methods, it can lead to information exposure. Possible consequences include attackers finding sensitive information in the WSDL or invoking non-public methods. Recommended mitigations focus on limiting access to the file, removing unnecessary sensitive details, and using generic method names.

# Summary bullet points

* WSDL files describe web service methods and can contain sensitive details
* If exposed beyond intended audience, this can lead to information disclosure
* Also a risk if file has info on non-public methods or helps guess private method names 
* Possible attack impact includes finding sensitive data or invoking private methods
