# Summary

The document describes CWE-1269, a weakness where a product is released to market in a pre-production or manufacturing configuration. Such configurations have many debug capabilities enabled, allowing overriding of cryptographic checks, reading/writing internal state, changing system configurations, and running hidden commands. This exposes the product to greater vulnerability. An example is provided where a manufacturing fuse is meant to be blown at the end of manufacturing to disable these capabilities, but is forgotten, leaving the system vulnerable.  

The document explains the complexity when multiple parties are involved in pre-production testing and the responsibility to disable manufacturing-only capabilities before release. It emphasizes the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability if a product retains manufacturing-only access. Potential mitigations are to have markers denoting manufacturing complete, and ensuring they are set properly to disable debug capabilities.

# Summary bullet points

* Products in manufacturing stages have debug hooks enabled, allowing cryptographic bypass, access to internal state, hidden commands, etc.
* Forgetting to disable these capabilities before release leaves products vulnerable. 
* With multiple vendors involved in manufacturing, responsibility to disable capabilities can be unclear.
* Impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability of released products.
* Mitigate by using markers to denote manufacturing complete and ensuring they are set.
