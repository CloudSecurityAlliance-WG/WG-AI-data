Message:  # Summary

The CWE-39 weakness describes a vulnerability where a product accepts user input containing a Windows drive letter that could redirect access to an unintended location or arbitrary file. This could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code/commands, modify/read sensitive files, or cause denial of service. Examples are provided of this weakness allowing remote code execution, arbitrary file reads, and denial of service in various contexts. Mitigations focus on stringent input validation, filtering potentially dangerous characters, and using multiple attributes to identify permitted files.
