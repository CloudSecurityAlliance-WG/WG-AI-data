# Summary

The document describes CWE-620, a common weakness in software systems related to unverified password changes. It explains that CWE-620 involves allowing users to change passwords without requiring knowledge of the original password or other authentication. This enables attackers to modify other users' passwords and gain access to their accounts. The weakness stems from flawed authentication practices during password change functionality in systems.

The key impacts are attackers potentially gaining unauthorized access and assuming the identity of legitimate users by hijacking their accounts via illicit password changes. Suggested mitigations include forcing users to provide current passwords before allowing new passwords as well as avoiding "forgotten password" flows that could expose the weakness. 

CWE-620 falls under the broader categories of authentication failures, access control issues, and credential management vulnerabilities that can enable broken authentication scenarios. It ranks among the most common and critical software weaknesses according to multiple frameworks like the OWASP Top 10.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-620 involves allowing password changes without current password or other authentication
* Enables attackers to take over user accounts by changing passwords
* Ranked highly on multiple vulnerability ranking frameworks 
* Key impacts are loss of account control, assumption of user identities
* Stem from flaws in authentication logic during password change functions
* Mitigations include requiring current password for new password to be set
* Also, avoid flawed "forgotten password" flows
