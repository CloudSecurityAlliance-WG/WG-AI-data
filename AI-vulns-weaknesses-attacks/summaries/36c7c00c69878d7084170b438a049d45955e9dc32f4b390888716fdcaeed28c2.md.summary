Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-563, a common weakness enumeration related to assigning a value to a variable that is never subsequently used. This results in dead store and indicates potential quality issues or bugs. Specifically, it involves declaring a variable, assigning it a value, then either reassigning it or letting it go out of scope without using the initial value. This could be indicative of vestigial code or a bug. It can lead to further weaknesses being introduced that impact quality and security. The mitigation is to remove unused variables from the codebase.
