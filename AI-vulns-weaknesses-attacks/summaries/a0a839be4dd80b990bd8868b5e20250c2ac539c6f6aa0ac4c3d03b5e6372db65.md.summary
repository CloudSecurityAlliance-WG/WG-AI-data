Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1066 weakness describes a situation where a serializable data element in a product does not have an associated serialization method. This can lead to reliability issues like exceptions being triggered, which could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if reachable by attackers. Specifically, serializable data elements may use serialization attributes or interfaces in languages like .NET and Java. This weakness is considered an indirect quality issue that could make it easier to introduce security weaknesses or make them harder to detect. It is related to broader concepts like improper adherence to coding standards and poor coding practices. The weakness has been prohibited from use in vulnerability mapping due to having no direct security implications.
