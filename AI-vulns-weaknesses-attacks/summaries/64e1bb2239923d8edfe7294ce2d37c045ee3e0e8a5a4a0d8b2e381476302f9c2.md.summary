# Summary

The document describes the CWE-196 weakness related to unsigned to signed conversion errors in software. It explains that converting an unsigned primitive type to a signed type can produce unexpected values if the unsigned value is too large to be represented by the signed type. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, buffer overflows/underflows, and arbitrary code execution. Key mitigations include using languages not susceptible to these flaws, adding input validation, using unsigned variables for sizes, and error checking return values.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-196 relates to unsigned to signed conversion errors in software
* Converting large unsigned values to signed can produce unexpected/invalid values
* Can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, buffer overflows/underflows 
* May allow attackers arbitrary code execution or bypass protections
* Mitigations: use safe languages, input validation, unsigned sizes, error checking
