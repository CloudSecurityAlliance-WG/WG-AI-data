Message:  # Summary

The document discusses the CWE-37 weakness related to path traversal vulnerabilities. It explains that the weakness occurs when a product accepts user input containing absolute file paths without proper validation, allowing attackers to traverse the file system to unauthorized locations and access arbitrary files. Some key points:

- Path traversal flaws allow reading/modifying unintended files and directories.

- Can occur in many contexts like FTP clients, zip extractors, web apps. 

- Attacks can overwrite sensitive files or obtain unauthorized data access.

- Strong input validation is key mitigation - filter dangerous characters, limit extensions/path depth, canonicalize.

- Decoding inputs more than once can bypass validation checks.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-37 is a path traversal weakness where unvalidated user input with absolute file paths allows unintended file/directory access.
* Consequences include reading/modifying unintended files and directories, overwriting sensitive data.
* Affects software like FTP, zip utilities, web apps. Historical examples provided.  
* Mitigations focus on thorough input validation - allowlists of permitted characters/extensions, canonicalization, avoiding double decoding.
* Decoding user input more than once could bypass validation schemes.
