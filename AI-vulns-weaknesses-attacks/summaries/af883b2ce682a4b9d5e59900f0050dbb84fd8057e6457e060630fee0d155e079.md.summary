Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-64, a common weakness in software systems related to improperly handling Windows shortcut (.LNK) files. The weakness stems from products not sufficiently validating shortcut files that point outside the intended directory structure, enabling attackers to access unauthorized files. Consequences include reading/modifying files attackers lack permissions for. Mitigations focus on properly compartmentalizing file systems and following principle of least privilege when assigning file access rights.
