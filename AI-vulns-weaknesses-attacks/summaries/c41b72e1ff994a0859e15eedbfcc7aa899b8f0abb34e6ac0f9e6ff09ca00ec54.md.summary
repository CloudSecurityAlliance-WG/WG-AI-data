# Summary

The document describes CWE-1071, a common weakness enumeration related to empty code blocks in software. Empty code blocks do not contain any executable code and may indicate incomplete implementation, accidental deletion of code, unexpected macro expansion, etc. They can occur in conditionals, functions, exception handlers, synchronized blocks, etc.

Empty exception handlers or synchronized blocks can reduce reliability and fail to handle errors or thread safety properly. Empty blocks may violate conventions or APIs even if allowed syntactically. They demonstrate poor coding practices that could introduce weaknesses or make vulnerabilities harder to detect.
