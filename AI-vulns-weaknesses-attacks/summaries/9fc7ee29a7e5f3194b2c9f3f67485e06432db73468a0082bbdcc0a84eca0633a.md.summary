Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of initializing data using hard-coded values that act as network resource identifiers. This can prevent the product from running reliably if it runs in an environment that does not use those hardcoded identifiers. If reachable by an attacker, this reliability issue could introduce a vulnerability. It is considered an indirect weakness that could make it easier to introduce security weaknesses or make them harder to detect.
