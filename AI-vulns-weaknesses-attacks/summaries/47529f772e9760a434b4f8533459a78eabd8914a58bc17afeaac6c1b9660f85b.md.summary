# Summary

The text discusses CWE-531, a weakness related to the inclusion of sensitive information in test code for applications. It explains that test applications often contain administrative functions, usernames, passwords, session identifiers, system configuration details, etc. that developers don't expect anyone besides themselves to access. However, leaving this sensitive data in test code poses security risks if the code is accidentally released or made public in some way. The consequences can include unauthorized parties gaining access to read application data. It recommends removing test code containing sensitive information before deploying an application to production.

# Summary bullet points

* Test applications often contain sensitive information like administrative functions, usernames, passwords etc. that pose security risks if exposed
* Developers often don't consider that anyone besides themselves would access test code/apps so they include sensitive information
* Exposing test code can enable unauthorized reading of application data 
* Recommended mitigation is removing test code with sensitive information before deployment to production
