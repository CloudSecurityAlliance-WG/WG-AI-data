Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of using the same public key for signing both debug and production firmware code. This enables an attacker who gains access to the debug firmware image to run it on production machines, opening up internal debug capabilities. It is recommended to use different public keys for debug and production firmware to limit damage if debug firmware leaks.

# Summary bullet points

* Using same public key for signing debug and production firmware enables debug firmware to run on production machines if compromised
* Debug firmware provides additional capabilities that could allow attacker full system control if accessed 
* Good practice is to use different public keys for debug and production firmware 
* If debug and production firmware use different keys, a leak of debug firmware will not allow it to run on production machines, limiting damage
* Recommendation is to use different keys for production and debug firmware
