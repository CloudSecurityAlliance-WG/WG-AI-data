Message:  # Summary

Path traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files and directories outside of an intended restricted directory by manipulating pathnames. This is often accomplished by using sequences like "../" to move up directories. Consequences include reading/writing sensitive files, executing code, bypassing authentication mechanisms, denial of service, and more. Proper input validation, canonicalization, and other protections are key to preventing path traversal.  

# Summary bullet points

* Path traversal involves manipulating pathnames to access files/dirs outside an intended restricted directory, often using "../" 
* Consequences range from reading sensitive files to code execution, authentication bypass, denial of service, etc.
* Input validation, canonicalization, and other protections are critical to stop path traversal 
* Variants can use absolute paths, drive letters, null bytes, alternate encodings, and OS-specific features
* Error messages can expose path info that helps attackers optimize attacks
* Safe libraries/frameworks, sandboxes, firewalls provide some mitigation capabilities
