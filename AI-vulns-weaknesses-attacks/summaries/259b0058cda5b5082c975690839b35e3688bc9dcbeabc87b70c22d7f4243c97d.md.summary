Message:  # Summary

The text describes the weakness CWE-548 - Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing. It explains that this weakness occurs when a directory listing is inappropriately exposed, providing attackers potentially sensitive information about the files and directories on a system. Some key points:

- Directory listings give attackers an index of all resources in a directory, enabling them to access or exploit files. The risks vary based on the specific files listed.

- It can allow attackers to gain access to source code, obtain information to devise exploits by seeing file details like creation times, or compromise private/confidential data.  

- Recommended mitigations include restricting access to important directories using need-to-know access control, and disabling automatic directory listings.

- Static analysis tools can detect some cases of this weakness by modeling data/control flow to find potentially vulnerable patterns connecting sources to sinks.

# Summary bullet points

* Can allow access to source code, information to devise exploits, compromise of private data
* Mitigations: restrict directory access, disable automatic listings 
* Static analysis tools can detect some cases by identifying vulnerable source-sink patterns
