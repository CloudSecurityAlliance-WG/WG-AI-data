Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of using weak credentials such as default, hardcoded, or easily guessed passwords and keys (CWE-1391). This enables attackers to easily gain access without brute force guessing. Examples are provided of OT/ICS products found to have such weak credentials in an external study. The weakness is applicable across languages, OSes, architectures and technologies. It is relevant to access control failures and has mappings to several IEC 62443 security standard requirements.
