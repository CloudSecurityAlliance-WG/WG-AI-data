# Summary

The paper proposes an algorithm called DeepFool to efficiently compute adversarial perturbations that can fool deep neural network classifiers. The key ideas are:

- They first present the algorithm for binary classifiers by iteratively linearizing the classifier and finding the projection onto the classifier boundary. This is extended to the multiclass case in a one-vs-all scheme.

- Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show DeepFool can find smaller adversarial perturbations compared to prior methods like the fast gradient sign method. It also runs faster than optimization-based approaches.

- Fine-tuning classifiers on the DeepFool adversarial examples can significantly enhance robustness to perturbations. However, using the fast gradient method's larger perturbations for fine-tuning can sometimes hurt robustness.

- Approximating adversarial examples can lead to wrong conclusions about classifier robustness. DeepFool gives a more accurate estimate of robustness.

Overall, DeepFool provides an efficient way to accurately estimate minimal adversarial perturbations. This helps better understand classifier robustness.
