# Summary

The document describes CWE-410, a weakness related to insufficient resource pools in software. Specifically, it refers to when a product's resource pool, such as database connections or threads, is not large enough to handle peak demand. This allows attackers to prevent legitimate access to resources by flooding the pool with a large number of requests. The result is often a denial of service through resource exhaustion. Insufficient resource pools are a common weakness that can lead to availability and integrity issues. The content describes the weakness in detail and provides examples of vulnerable configurations. It highlights the risk of denial of service attacks and recommends properly sizing resource pools. Though not specifically mentioned, this weakness could also impact AI systems that rely on constrained resources like GPUs. Preventing resource exhaustion is critical for reliability.
