Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1062 weakness describes a software code issue where a parent class contains direct references to a child class, its methods, or members. This tight coupling between parent and child classes violates encapsulation best practices. The main risk is reduced reliability - if the child class changes, the parent may break in unexpected ways. There are no direct security implications, but poor coding practices indirectly harm security.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1062 is a software weakness related to poor encapsulation and tight coupling between parent and child classes
* The main risk is reduced reliability if child classes change unexpectedly
* No direct security impact, but poor coding indirectly enables vulnerabilities
* References between parent and child classes should use inheritance and polymorphism 
* Weakness has indirect ordinality - a quality issue that enables other weaknesses
