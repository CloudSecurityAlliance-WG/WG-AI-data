# Summary

The content describes CWE-416, a weakness related to the use of memory after it has been freed (use after free). It can cause crashes, unexpected behavior, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution. Main causes are error conditions leading to premature freeing of memory, and confusion over which part of code is responsible for freeing memory. It provides details on consequences, examples, mitigations, detection methods and related concepts.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes use after free weakness (CWE-416) - using freed memory leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, data corruption, code execution
* Main causes are error conditions and confusion over memory management responsibilities 
* Consequences include data corruption, crashes, unauthorized code execution
* Provides language examples, real-world vulnerability examples 
* Suggested mitigations include setting freed pointers to NULL, using languages with automatic memory management
* Detection methods include fuzz testing and static analysis
* Related to expired pointer dereference, double free, signal handler races
