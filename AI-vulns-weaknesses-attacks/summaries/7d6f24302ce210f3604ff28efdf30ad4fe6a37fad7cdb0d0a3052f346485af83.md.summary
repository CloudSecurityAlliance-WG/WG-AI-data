Message:  # Summary

The CWE-707 entry describes the weakness of improper neutralization, which occurs when a product does not properly ensure that structured messages or data are well-formed and meet certain security properties before being processed. This can lead to malformed input causing messages to be incorrectly interpreted. Neutralization encompasses various techniques like validation, filtering, encoding/decoding etc. to make input and output conform to expectations and be safe. This weakness typically manifests when malicious input intended as data enters a control plane and is processed as control messages like commands or queries instead. It leads to security implications like incorrect interpretation of messages.
