Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-167 describes the weakness of improper handling of additional unexpected special elements in input. This occurs when a product receives input from an upstream component but does not properly handle or incorrectly handles the case when an additional unexpected special element, such as an extra "<" character, is provided in the input. This can lead to vulnerabilities where attackers are able to bypass security protections by injecting unexpected input that is not properly sanitized or validated.

The key impacts are:

- Unexpected state or behavior of the system, leading to integrity issues 
- Potential for attackers to bypass input validation or filtering
- Increased vulnerability to code injection attacks

Recommended mitigations focus on: 

- Assuming all inputs are malicious and validating/filtering them against an allow list 
- Encoding outputs to prevent injection attacks
- Decoding and canonicalizing all inputs before validation

So in summary, CWE-167 describes a weakness where systems fail to anticipate or handle unexpected special characters or elements in inputs, which attackers can potentially exploit to compromise the system. The key remedy is proper input validation and output encoding.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-167 deals with improper handling of unexpected special elements in input
* Occurs when systems do not properly handle extra or unexpected characters/elements in inputs 
* Can enable attackers to bypass filters or injections attacks
* Leads to unexpected behavior or state, integrity issues
* Mitigations focus on input validation, output encoding, decoding/canonicalizing input
* Overall, systems should assume malicious input and sanitize properly against allow lists
