# Summary

CWE-765 describes a weakness where a product unlocks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system. This can happen in concurrent environments where the product repeatedly unlocks a resource. The consequences vary based on the type of lock, implementation, and protected resource. Extra unlock calls may increase resource counts, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior. 

# Summary bullet points
