# Summary

The document defines CWE-1023 - Incomplete Comparison with Missing Factors, a type of software weakness related to performing incomplete comparisons between entities. This occurs when a comparison does not include all necessary factors or characteristics of the entities being compared. The consequence is the potential to operate on the wrong object or make incorrect security decisions by not considering all required factors. Examples are provided such as comparing truck objects based only on make and model but excluding the year, or authenticating users by only partially checking passwords. Mitigations include thoroughly testing comparison logic, and related weaknesses are incorrect comparisons in general or incomplete comparisons for specific types of data like input filtering.
