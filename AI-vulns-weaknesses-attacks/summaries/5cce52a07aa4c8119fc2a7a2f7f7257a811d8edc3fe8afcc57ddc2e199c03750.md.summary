Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the content:

# Summary

The content describes CWE-927, a weakness related to the use of implicit intents for transmitting sensitive data in Android applications. An implicit intent does not specify the receiving application, allowing any application to intercept the data. This can expose sensitive data to untrusted applications. Two issues highlighted are ordered broadcast intents, which allow receivers to alter data or deny propagation, and sticky broadcast intents, which remain accessible over time, increasing exposure risk. The content advises using explicit intents to trusted applications or individual components instead of implicit intents wherever possible to avoid data exposure.  

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-927 is a weakness related to using implicit Android intents for sensitive communications
* Implicit intents allow any app to receive data, exposing it to untrusted apps
* Ordered broadcast intents allow receivers to alter data or stop propagation 
* Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible over time, increasing exposure
* Implicit intents should be avoided for sensitive data - use explicit intents instead
