# Summary

The article describes CWE-581, a common software weakness related to the object model in Java. Specifically, it points out that Java requires objects that are equal (as determined by the equals() method) to have equal hashCode() values. If an object overrides equals() but fails to maintain this invariant by not overriding hashCode() accordingly, it can cause problems when using those objects as keys in hash-based collections like HashSet and HashMap. 

The key points are:

- Failing to make equals() and hashCode() consistent violates intended object behavior in Java
- Can cause errors if such objects are used in hash collections
- Override both methods if overriding equals(), keep hash codes equal for equal objects

# Summary bullet points

* Describes CWE-581 weakness - failing to override hashCode() when overriding equals() in Java objects
* Violates intended object behavior - equal objects should have equal hashCode() values
* Causes errors if used in hash collections like HashSet
* To fix, override both equals() and hashCode(), keep hash codes equal
* Applies to Java language
* References CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard rules
