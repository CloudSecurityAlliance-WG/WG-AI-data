# Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of firmware not being updateable (CWE-1277). Without the ability to patch or update firmware, devices are left permanently vulnerable to exploitation of any vulnerabilities that are discovered. This can allow attackers to gain privileges, bypass protections, or cause denial of service. Specifically for Internet-connected devices like smart home appliances or IoT devices, not having updateable firmware means attackers may be able to compromise an entire class of devices by finding one vulnerability. The entry outlines requirements, architecture/design, and implementation measures to mitigate this by designing firmware update capabilities into devices. It also provides manual analysis methods to detect non-updateable firmware. 

Examples are provided of real-world impact, like hackers compromising "smart lock" devices that cannot have firmware updated after discovering a vulnerability. Another example is attackers exploiting an OS command injection vulnerability in network-attached storage devices to install IoT botnet malware, which persists because many affected devices are end-of-support and can't be patched.

So in summary, non-updateable firmware leaves devices permanently at risk of compromise which can be exploited to impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Firmware update capabilities need to be properly designed and implemented to remediate vulnerabilities as they are discovered.

# Summary bullet points

* Without updateable firmware, devices are permanently vulnerable to newly discovered exploits
* This allows attackers to gain privileges, bypass protections, execute commands/code, or cause denial of service  
* Affects Internet-connected devices like smart appliances and IoT
* By finding one vulnerability in one device type, attackers can exploit the entire class
* Requirements should specify firmware update capability 
* Architecture and design needs to incorporate firmware update distribution and authentication
* Lack of updates enables attackers to build botnets, access devices after support ends
* Real-world attacks have targeted "smart locks" and network-attached storage through this
* Manual analysis methods given to detect non-updateable firmware
