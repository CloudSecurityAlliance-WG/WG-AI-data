Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges in software products. When a product attempts to access resources or functions but lacks the necessary privileges, instead of handling the failure properly, it may follow unexpected code paths that leave the system in an invalid state. This can alter execution logic and impact technical functionality of the system. Some examples are provided of FTP servers and file systems that fail to restrict access or change permissions appropriately when users lack sufficient privileges. Recommended mitigations include compartmentalizing the system into "safe" areas with unambiguous trust boundaries, always checking privilege levels before attempting access, and implementing proper error handling. The weakness enables attackers to gain unauthorized access or make unauthorized changes by exploiting the product's faulty privilege checking. Proper privilege separation and granular permission models can limit its occurrence.

# Summary bullet points

* Software weakness where products fail to properly handle cases when insufficient privileges exist to access resources/functions
* Can cause products to follow unexpected code paths, leaving systems in invalid states
* Alters execution logic and impacts technical functionality
* Enables attackers to gain unauthorized access via faulty privilege checking
* Mitigations include privilege separation, compartmentalization, always checking permissions before access 
* Implementing granular permission models helps prevent weakness
