Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1050 weakness describes excessive platform resource consumption within a loop, which can reduce performance or enable denial of service attacks if an attacker can influence the number of loop iterations. Specifically, it refers to a loop that contains a control element that directly or indirectly consumes resources like messages, sessions, locks, or file descriptors. This can make the product perform more slowly over time.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1050 refers to excessive platform resource consumption within a loop body or loop condition
* This can reduce performance over time as resources like messages, sessions, locks, file descriptors build up
* It can also enable denial of service if an attacker controls the number of loop iterations
* It is considered an indirect weakness that can make it easier to introduce other security weaknesses
* Relationships show it is a child of asymmetric resource consumption and a member of bad coding practices
