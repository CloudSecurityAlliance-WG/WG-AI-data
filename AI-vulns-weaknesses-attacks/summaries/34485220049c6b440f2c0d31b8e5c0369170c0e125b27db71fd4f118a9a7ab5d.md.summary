Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-622, a common weakness enumeration related to improper validation of function hook arguments. It explains that the weakness occurs when a product adds hooks to user-accessible API functions but fails to properly validate the arguments passed to those hooks. This could enable attackers to bypass protection schemes or attack the product itself. The weakness is related to improper input validation more broadly and can lead to unexpected system states or denial of service. Examples of real-world vulnerabilities exhibiting this weakness are provided. Potential mitigations include ensuring all hook arguments are validated per API specifications and dropping privileges before invoking hooked functions when possible.
