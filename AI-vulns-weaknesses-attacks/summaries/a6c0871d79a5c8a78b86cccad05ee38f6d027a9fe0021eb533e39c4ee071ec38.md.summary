Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of a product not properly determining its own internal state, causing it to incorrectly assume it is in one state when it is actually in another. This can lead to improper security-relevant operations. It is related to insufficient state verification, inability to handle out-of-order operations, and problems interpreting internal state. The impact is unexpected behavior depending on the product's function.
