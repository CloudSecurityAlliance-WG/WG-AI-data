Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1069 weakness describes empty exception handling blocks in code that do not contain any handling logic. This can reduce reliability by failing to appropriately deal with exceptions. The example shows Java code with an empty catch block that catches an ArithmeticException but takes no action. The improved code logs the error and sets the problematic value to a default.
