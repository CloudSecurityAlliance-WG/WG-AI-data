Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an insecure security identifier mechanism vulnerability that can exist in integrated circuit systems-on-chip (SoCs). The vulnerability involves flawed implementation of the security identifiers used to differentiate allowed and disallowed actions from various agents in the system. Flaws can include missing identifiers, improper conversion, incorrect generation, etc. This can lead to compromised confidentiality, integrity, and availability through unauthorized access, code execution, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

The vulnerability is applicable to hardware architectures and technologies like bus interfaces and SoC components. It can be introduced in the architecture/design and implementation phases. Potential mitigations involve reviewing decoder designs and testing access/programming flows pre and post-silicon.
