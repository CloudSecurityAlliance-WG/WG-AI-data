Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1086 weakness describes a class that contains an unnecessarily large number of child classes, defined as more than 10 by default. This makes the software more difficult to understand and maintain, indirectly reducing security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. It also can make introducing new vulnerabilities easier. The issue impacts maintainability and is considered an indirect weakness that enables other more direct weaknesses.

# Summary bullet points
