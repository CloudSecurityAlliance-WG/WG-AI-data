# Summary

The document describes CWE-694, a weakness related to the use of multiple resources with duplicate identifiers in contexts where unique identifiers are required. If a product assumes resources have unique IDs but attackers can create duplicates, the product may operate on the wrong resource. This can allow attackers to bypass access controls or cause quality degradation. The weakness is applicable across languages and platforms. It is a child of broader weaknesses related to specification violation and improper control of identifiers. Potential mitigations include using unique identifiers where possible and not operating on any resource with a non-unique ID, instead reporting errors.
