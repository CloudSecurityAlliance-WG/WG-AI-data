# Summary

The paper presents a new backdoor attack called Sleeper Agent that can effectively compromise deep neural networks trained from scratch. The attack hides the trigger during training by enforcing an l1 norm constraint on perturbations to poisoned images, making them difficult to detect visually. Key features include:

- Gradient matching between training and adversarial objectives to solve the bilevel optimization problem rather than direct solvers or feature collision. 
- Data selection to choose images with high impact on training to maximize attack effectiveness.  
- Adaptive retraining of the surrogate model during crafting to better approximate victim training.
- Black-box effectiveness without knowledge of the victim's architecture or training details.

Experiments show Sleeper Agent succeeds in attacking ImageNet models by poisoning only 0.05% of the training data. It also works against defenses like activation clustering, DP-SGD, and data augmentation, but they induce a large drop in clean validation accuracy. Overall, the method represents an effective and concerning backdoor threat against real-world deep learning systems.
