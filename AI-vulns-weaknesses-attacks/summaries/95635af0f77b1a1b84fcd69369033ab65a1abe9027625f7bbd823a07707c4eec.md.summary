Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness where a regular expression used for input validation or security does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values. This effectively causes the regex to accept partial matches, enabling attackers to bypass protections. Common problems include failing to anchor the expression to identify the start and end of the target string, using wildcards instead of acceptable ranges, and more. This can enable injection attacks, file inclusion, and other weaknesses if exploited.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-625 describes a weakness where a permissive regular expression fails to sufficiently validate input, enabling attackers to bypass protections.
* Failing to anchor the start and end of the target string, using wildcards instead of ranges, and other issues can allow partial matches. 
* This enables attackers to inject additional commands or insert malicious strings that get improperly validated.
* Can result in code injection, file inclusion, pinging blocked systems, and other attacks if exploited.  
* Proper anchoring, tighter validation ranges, and other improvements can mitigate.
