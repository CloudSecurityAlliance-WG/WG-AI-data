# Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of relying on unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior in code. This can lead to problems when the code is ported across platforms or unexpected interactions occur. Examples are provided such as relying on a function being at a fixed memory address or returning a stack address. The consequences can include crashes, memory corruption, or allowing attackers to inject arbitrary code. Recommended detection methods are fuzz testing to trigger unexpected conditions.
