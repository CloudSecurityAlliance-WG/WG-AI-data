Message:  # Summary

The CWE-453 weakness describes insecure default variable initialization, where a variable is initialized to an insecure or less secure default value than necessary. This can allow attackers to modify sensitive data or gain unauthorized access. The example shows PHP code vulnerable to this issue - the $authorized variable is not explicitly initialized, so PHP sets it to any value in the POST request. If register_globals is enabled, an attacker can set 'authorized' to 'true' and gain access without valid credentials. Recommendations include disabling register_globals in PHP, not relying on default initialization, and changing default settings that could enable abuse.
