Message:  # Summary

This text discusses poisoning attacks on machine learning models, where an attacker contaminates the training data to manipulate the model's predictions. It provides an example of a medical dataset where researchers introduced malicious samples that changed a model's dosage predictions for patients. 

The text mentions other data tampering scenarios, such as deliberate or unintentional manipulation by AI/ML designers, data manipulation during storage or processing, and attackers leveraging knowledge of data filtering schemes. It also discusses adversaries manipulating hyperparameters to influence model behavior, either intentionally for attacks or accidentally by overfitting.

The key message is that poisoning attacks and data tampering can severely impact model performance and lead to discrimination if bias is introduced. Companies need protections against these threats from external attackers as well as insider risks.
