Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

CWE-478 describes a weakness where code with multiple conditional expressions, such as a switch statement, is missing a default case to handle unexpected or unanticipated values. This can lead to unexpected program execution and weaknesses like denial of service, data loss, or bypass of security checks. The mitigation is to ensure a default case exists to handle any unaccounted for values.
