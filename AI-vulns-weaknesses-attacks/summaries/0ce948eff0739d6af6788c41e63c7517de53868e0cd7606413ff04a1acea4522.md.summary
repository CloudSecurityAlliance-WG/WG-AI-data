Message:  # Summary

The text summarizes different types of adversarial attacks against machine learning models, with a focus on evasion, poisoning, extraction, and inference attacks. It provides an overview of various whitebox and blackbox attack techniques published in research papers, along with tags indicating which attacks have implementations available in the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART). 

Some of the key attacks highlighted include:

- Evasion attacks like Auto-Attack, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and Carlini & Wagner attacks that generate imperceptible perturbations to cause misclassifications. 
- Poisoning attacks like backdoor attacks that inject malicious data during training to compromise model behavior.  
- Extraction attacks that steal information about a target model's parameters or training data.
- Inference attacks like attribute inference and membership inference that learn sensitive information about the model's training data.

The text seems to be an overview page from the ART project wiki, summarizing the different adversarial threats that ART provides implementations for. There is a focus on security implications, covering various methods that attackers could use to undermine, extract information from, or cause unintended behaviors in machine learning models.
