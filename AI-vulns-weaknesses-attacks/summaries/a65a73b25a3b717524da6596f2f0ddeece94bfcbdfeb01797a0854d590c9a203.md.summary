The text appears to be extracted from a website called PLOT4ai, which contains a library of AI/ML threats categorized into 8 different groups. The site provides a card game, assessments, and other resources related to identifying risks in AI systems. 

The core threat highlighted in the text is related to AI explainability - whether users might perceive the output or messages from an AI system differently than the creators intended. It emphasizes that explainability is critical for end users to take informed actions based on AI system outputs. The text suggests that if users may perceive messages differently than intended or if you are unsure about explainability of your system, you are at risk.

Overall, the text focuses on risks that can emerge if AI systems are not sufficiently explainable to end users, such that misunderstandings or unintended consequences could occur. Explainability appears as a key theme related to ethical and secure development of AI.
