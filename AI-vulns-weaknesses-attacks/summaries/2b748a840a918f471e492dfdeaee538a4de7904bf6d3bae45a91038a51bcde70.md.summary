Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-291 weakness describes the vulnerability of relying solely on IP addresses for authentication. IP addresses can be easily spoofed, allowing attackers to impersonate trusted clients. Proper authentication should use additional factors beyond IP address, such as usernames/passwords or certificates. 

This weakness enables attackers to hide activities, gain privileges, and assume false identities by spoofing IP addresses. The likelihood of exploit is high due to the ease of IP address spoofing. 

Examples are provided in C and Java where authentication checks only the request packet's claimed source IP address. This allows the address to be spoofed, bypassing authentication.
