# Summary

The weakness described is improper access control in fabric bridges used to connect different IP blocks in hardware system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Bridges translate between different bus protocols but need to maintain consistent access control privileges when routing transactions. If the bridge does not properly check privileges and identities of transactions, it creates a security weakness that allows bypassing of access controls between IP blocks. This can enable unauthorized reads/writes, denial-of-service attacks, and compromise of confidentiality/integrity. Proper access control checks must be designed into the bridge hardware and implemented to validate identities and privileges on all transactions.

# Summary bullet points

* Weakness involves lack of proper access control checks in bridges between IP blocks in SoC hardware
* Bridges translate between different interconnect buses but must maintain consistent access control
* Failure to validate privileges/identities of transactions enables bypassing of access controls 
* Allows unauthorized access for reads/writes to protected memory regions
* Can lead to denial of service, data confidentiality and integrity issues
* Proper hardware-based access control checks must be designed and implemented in bridges
