Message:  # Summary

The document discusses the weakness of dangling database cursors (CWE-619). A dangling cursor occurs when a database cursor is not properly closed after use, leaving it accessible to other users with the original privileges. This can enable SQL injection attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Proper mitigation requires closing cursors immediately after accessing them and ensuring they are closed even when exceptions occur. The issue arises from unhandled exceptions or anytime cursors are not closed properly after use.
