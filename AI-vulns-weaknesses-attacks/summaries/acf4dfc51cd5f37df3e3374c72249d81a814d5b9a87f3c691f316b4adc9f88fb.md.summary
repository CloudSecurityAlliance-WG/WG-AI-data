Message:  # Summary

The document discusses CWE-463, which is the weakness of accidentally deleting data structure sentinels. Sentinels are used to mark the structure of data structures, such as a null character at the end of strings or a sentinel value to mark the end of a linked list. Accidentally deleting these can cause the data structure to not function properly. For example, deleting the null terminator of a string could cause unpredictable behavior when trying to print the string. The mitigations discussed include using abstraction libraries, compiler protections like buffer overflow protection, and OS-level preventative functionality.

# Summary bullet points

* Data structure sentinels mark structure of data structures, like null terminator for strings
* Accidental deletion of sentinels can cause data structure to not work properly
* May also cause resource access control problems if a control character is removed 
* Mitigations include abstraction libraries, compiler overflow protection, OS preventions
