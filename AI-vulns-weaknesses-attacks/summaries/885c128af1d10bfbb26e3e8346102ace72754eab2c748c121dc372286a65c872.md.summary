Message:  # Summary

This MITRE ATLAS page provides information on the machine learning model backdoor technique "Inject Payload." It involves adversaries introducing a backdoor into a model by injecting a payload that detects a specific trigger input and bypasses the model to produce the attacker's desired output instead. A case study is provided of a backdoor attack on deep learning models in mobile apps. Suggested mitigations are to control access to ML models and validate models. This is a sub-technique of the broader "Backdoor ML Model" technique and relates to the tactics of persistence and ML attack staging.

# Summary bullet points

* Adversaries can backdoor ML models by injecting payloads that activate on specific triggers
* The payload detects a trigger input and makes the model bypass normal processing to output what the attacker wants
* Example case study of backdoor attacks against deep learning models in mobile apps
* Mitigations include controlling access to models and validating model integrity
* A sub-technique of the broader "Backdoor ML Model" technique 
* Relevant to persistence and ML attack staging tactics
