Message:  # Summary

The text appears to be from a website or online library focused on threats related to AI and machine learning. It discusses various issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, adversarial attacks, and model vulnerability. 

The key points covered include:

- There are 86 AI/ML threats classified into 8 categories in this library 
- Certain machine learning models like SVMs and KNNs embed training data directly into the model, risking exposure of sensitive information
- Attackers can manipulate training data and exploit algorithmic bias
- Models should be evaluated for suitability before processing sensitive information 
- Algorithmic leakage through models is a privacy and security risk that needs to be addressed

The content aims to make AI/ML practitioners aware of various vulnerabilities and encourages risk assessment of models, especially regarding privacy and bias. There is also a license stating content is shared under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.
