Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-683, a common weakness enumeration related to calling functions with arguments in the incorrect order. This can lead to unintended behavior or security issues if the arguments are security-sensitive. 

The key points are:

- Calling a function but supplying the arguments in the wrong order can cause unintended behavior or security issues. This is common with functions that accept variable arguments.

- It often occurs due to programmer error like typos or copy-paste mistakes.

- It can allow attackers to bypass intended access restrictions if the arguments are related to authentication or access control.

- It typically leads to quality degradation or unexpected behavior.

- It is prevalent in languages without strong typing or that allow variable argument lists.

The example shows a PHP authentication function called with the password and username reversed, which could allow access control bypass.
