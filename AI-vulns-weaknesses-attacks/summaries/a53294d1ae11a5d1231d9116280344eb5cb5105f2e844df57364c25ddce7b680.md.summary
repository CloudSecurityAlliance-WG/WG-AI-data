# Summary

The document describes CWE-177, a common weakness related to the improper handling of URL encoding, also known as hex encoding. When software does not properly handle input that contains URL encoding, attackers can manipulate the input to access unauthorized files or inject malicious input. Consequences include unexpected application states and integrity impacts. Examples demonstrate variants using encoded characters like nulls, spaces, dots, slashes, and carriage returns to bypass filters or cause crashes. Mitigations emphasize validating input properly by decoding, canonicalizing, checking against strict allowlists, and considering all relevant properties rather than just syntax. Mapping details explain why this CWE ID is acceptable for mapping real-world vulnerabilities. Overall, the content covers risks and defenses relevant to information security and AI safety involving improper neutralization.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-177 refers to improper handling of URL encoding which can enable attacks if software does not validate encoded input properly
* Attackers manipulate URL encoded input to bypass filters or access restricted files and inject malicious code
* Consequences include unexpected application states, crashes, and impacts to integrity
* Mitigations involve input validation strategies like decoding, canonicalizing, allowlisting acceptable values, and checking properties beyond just syntax
* The ID can be used to map real-world vulnerabilities as it captures root causes at an appropriate level of abstraction
