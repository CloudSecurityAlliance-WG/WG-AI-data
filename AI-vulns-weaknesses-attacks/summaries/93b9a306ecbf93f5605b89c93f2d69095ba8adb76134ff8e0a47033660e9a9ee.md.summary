The paper presents the concept of universal adversarial perturbations - small image-agnostic perturbations that can fool state-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers on most natural images with high probability. The key points are:

- Universal adversarial perturbations exist that can fool classifiers on most natural images with over 80% probability, while being quasi-imperceptible to humans. An algorithm is proposed to compute such perturbations.

- The universal perturbations generalize remarkably well across different classifiers and architectures, including VGG, GoogLeNet and ResNet. This makes them doubly universal - across images and models. 

- The vulnerability to such perturbations reveals geometric correlations among different parts of classifiers' decision boundaries. A low-dimensional subspace is shown to exist that captures these correlations.

- Random vectors in this subspace significantly outperform random perturbations in fooling classifiers, explaining the effectiveness of the computed universal perturbations. 

- Fine-tuning the classifiers with perturbed images leads to some increase in robustness, but the networks still remain largely vulnerable to universal perturbations.

# Summary bullet points

* Universal adversarial perturbations exist that fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks on most natural images with high probability (>80%)
* Proposed algorithm to compute image-agnostic perturbations by aggregating minimal perturbations sending data points to decision boundary
* Perturbations generalize remarkably well to unseen images despite using small training set 
* Also double universal - generalize across neural network architectures (VGG, GoogLeNet etc)
* Reveals geometric correlations among parts of decision boundary 
* Existence of low-dimensional subspace capturing these correlations explains effectiveness
* Fine-tuning network with perturbed images only leads to mild robustness increase
