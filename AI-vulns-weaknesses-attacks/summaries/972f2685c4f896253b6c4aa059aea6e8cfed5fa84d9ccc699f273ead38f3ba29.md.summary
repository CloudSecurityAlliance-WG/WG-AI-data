# Summary

The document describes CWE-38, a weakness related to path traversal vulnerabilities. Specifically, it discusses how software products that accept input with absolute file paths (e.g. '\absolute\pathname\here') without proper validation can allow attackers to traverse the filesystem and access arbitrary files. It provides examples of CVEs related to this weakness. The document recommends input validation strategies such as allowlists to mitigate this issue. Software should validate inputs to ensure they conform strictly to specifications, reject invalid input, and safely handle decoding/encoding. Proper validation of filenames including limiting character sets and file extensions is also advised.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-38 involves path traversal vulnerabilities from unvalidated input with absolute file paths 
* Attackers can exploit this to traverse filesystem and access arbitrary files
* Examples provided of related CVEs
* Recommends input validation using allowlists and validating conformity to specifications 
* Validate file names by limiting character set and extensions
* Safely handle decoding/encoding of input
