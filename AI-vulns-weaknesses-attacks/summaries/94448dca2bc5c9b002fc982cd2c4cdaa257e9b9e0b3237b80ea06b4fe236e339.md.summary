Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-76, a common weakness enumeration related to the improper neutralization of equivalent special elements. It explains that while a product may filter certain special characters, it may fail to account for alternate encodings or representations that have the same meaning. For example, filtering a leading slash but not accounting for a tilde followed by a username which could represent an absolute path on some systems. Or filtering a dangerous "-e" switch when calling an external program but not filtering "--exec" which has the same semantics. This could allow attackers to bypass input filters and launch attacks through alternate representations of filtered elements.

The key ideas related to information security and AI security are the need for proper input sanitization and neutralization of all potential equivalent representations that could lead to vulnerabilities. Robust allowlists and denylists are required to account for alternate encodings. Failing to do so creates opportunities for command injection and other attacks.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-76 involves improperly neutralizing equivalent special elements that have the same meaning as filtered inputs
* Can allow attackers to bypass filters through alternate encodings like "~username" for absolute paths 
* Products may filter certain special elements but fail to account for equivalent representations
* Leads to command injection, path traversal, SQLi and other attacks
* Need robust allowlists/denylists to cover alternate encodings of filtered elements
* Applies to all input sanitization, not limited to command line or SQL
* High likelihood of exploit if not properly mitigated
