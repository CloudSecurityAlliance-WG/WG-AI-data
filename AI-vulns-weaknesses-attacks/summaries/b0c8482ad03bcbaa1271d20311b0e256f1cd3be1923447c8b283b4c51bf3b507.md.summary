# Summary

The content describes CWE-770 - Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. It explains that this weakness occurs when a product allocates reusable resources for an actor without restricting the size or number that can be allocated, violating the intended security policy. Without quotas or limits, attackers can consume resources rapidly through many requests, exhausting resources and causing denial of service. Examples show vulnerable code that allows unlimited connections, files, processes, memory allocation, etc. that could be exploited this way.

The mitigations suggest specifying resource expectations and acceptable behaviors, limiting accessible resources per user, throttling mechanisms, input validation, duplicating checks on client and server, recognizing attacks and denying access or uniformly throttling requests to make resource exhaustion harder. Detection methods include manual analysis, fuzzing, dynamic analysis to monitor side effects, and static analysis to find problems releasing resources or unchecked arguments.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-770 is allocation of resources without restrictions on size or number for an actor, violating security policy 
* Leads to uncontrolled resource consumption and denial of service by rapidly allocating resources
* Examples show unrestricted sockets, files, processes, memory allocation 
* Mitigations include resource quotas, limits, throttling mechanisms, input validation, fail safe design
* Detection via manual and automated static and dynamic analysis
