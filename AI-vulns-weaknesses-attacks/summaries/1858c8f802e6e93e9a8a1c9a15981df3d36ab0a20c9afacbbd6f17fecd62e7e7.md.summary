Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-599, a vulnerability related to missing validation of OpenSSL certificates. Specifically, it points out that some products use OpenSSL and trust or use certificates without properly validating them using the SSL_get_verify_result() function. This could allow attackers to use invalid, expired, or otherwise insecure certificates to spoof trusted hosts or conduct other attacks. The vulnerability is a child of CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation.

The document explains that failing to validate certificates could allow attackers to read application data that is not properly secured or bypass protection mechanisms through spoofing/redirection. It provides an code example in C demonstrating a vulnerability where the certificate is obtained but not validated.

The document recommends ensuring proper authentication in system design and understanding/implementing necessary certificate validation checks. It notes the similarity of CWE-599 to CWE-295, but points out CWE-599 is more narrowly focused on OpenSSL certificates specifically.
