# Summary

CWE-207 describes a weakness where a product operates in an environment where its identity should be unknown, but it behaves differently than equivalent products in observable ways that could allow an attacker to fingerprint it. This gives attackers more information to craft exploits. It often occurs when multiple products serve the same functions but have slight behavioral differences. Environments particularly vulnerable are ones where products are expected to behave identically so behavioral discrepancies stand out. The consequences enable attackers to better identify the product and version to create more efficient, targeted attacks.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-207 involves products meant to have hidden identities but are observable behaving differently than equivalent products
* These behavioral discrepancies allow attackers to fingerprint products when multiple options exist 
* Environments expecting products to behave identically are especially problematic
* Consequences include targeted, efficient attacks by identifying product and version
