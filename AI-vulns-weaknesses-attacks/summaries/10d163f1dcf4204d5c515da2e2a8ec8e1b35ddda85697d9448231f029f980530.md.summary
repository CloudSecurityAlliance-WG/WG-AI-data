Message:  # Summary

The weakness described is about Java runtime error messages containing sensitive information. Specifically, when unhandled exceptions occur in Java code, the error messages printed can expose sensitive details about the application's state or configuration. This could enable attackers to gain unauthorized access or exploit the system. The key mitigation is to avoid exposing sensitive error information to users in exception handling code.

# Summary bullet points

* Unhandled Java exceptions can print error messages exposing sensitive details
* Error messages may reveal file system paths, passwords, or other private info
* Attackers can leverage this to gain unauthorized access or exploit the system
* Mitigation is to avoid printing sensitive details in exception handling code
