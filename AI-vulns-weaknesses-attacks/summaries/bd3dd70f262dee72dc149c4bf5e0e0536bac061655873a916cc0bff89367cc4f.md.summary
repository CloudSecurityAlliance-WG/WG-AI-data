# Summary

CWE-467 describes a weakness where the sizeof() function is called on a pointer type, which returns the wordsize/8 instead of the actual size allocated. This can result in allocating insufficient memory if the developer intended to use sizeof() to determine the buffer size needed. The consequences include potential buffer overflows, modification of memory, and disclosure of memory contents. 

To mitigate this, expressions like "sizeof(*pointer)" should be used instead of "sizeof(pointer)" to get the actual size of the data structure instead of the pointer size. This helps allocate the intended buffer size.

# Summary bullet points

* Calling sizeof() on a pointer returns the wordsize/8 instead of the allocated size
* Can result in allocating insufficient memory for buffers
* Consequences include buffer overflows, memory modification, and disclosure
* Mitigations include using sizeof(*pointer) instead of sizeof(pointer)
* Helps get actual size of data structure instead of pointer size
