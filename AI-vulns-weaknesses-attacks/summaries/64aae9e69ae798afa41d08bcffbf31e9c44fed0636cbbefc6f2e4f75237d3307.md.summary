# Summary  

The paper proposes a new clean-label poisoning attack called Bullseye Polytope that creates a convex polytope around a target image in feature space. The attack optimizes the position of poison samples so that the target image resides close to the "center" of the polytope. This improves attack transferability and speed compared to prior work like Convex Polytope. Experiments show Bullseye Polytope achieves 7-27% higher success rates in transfer learning settings while being 10-36x faster. The attack is also extended to a multi-target mode which makes it robust to variations in test images. Defenses based on nearest neighbors and centroid checks are evaluated.
