Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-66, a common weakness enumeration related to the improper handling of file names that identify virtual resources. Virtual file names behave like normal files but are effectively aliases for resources that do not behave like regular files. Not properly handling these virtual file names can cause products to incorrectly perform file operations on non-file resources. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information or denial of service.
