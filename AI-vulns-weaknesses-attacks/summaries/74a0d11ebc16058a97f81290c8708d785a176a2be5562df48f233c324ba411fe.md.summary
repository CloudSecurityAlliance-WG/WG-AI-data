Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper handling of inconsistent special elements in input. This occurs when a product does not properly process input that contains inconsistencies between special characters or reserved words. An example is when paired characters appear in the wrong order or are not properly nested. This can lead to denial-of-service attacks, bypassing protection mechanisms, or hiding malicious activities. Recommended mitigations include using allowlists and denylists for input validation to only allow expected input, decoding and canonicalizing input before validation, and not relying solely on searches for malicious input.
