Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-439, a common weakness enumeration related to behavioral changes in a new version or environment of a system component that are not known or manageable by another interacting component. Specifically, it refers to cases where component A's behavior or functionality changes with a new version or environment, but component B is not aware of or able to properly handle this change. This can lead to quality degradation or other technical impacts depending on the context.

The document provides some examples of this weakness resulting in vulnerabilities, such as a Linux kernel allowing promiscuous mode using a new method that ifconfig is not programmed to handle, or case-insensitive code from Windows allowing reading of JSP source code because it does not differentiate .jsp and .JSP extensions.

It describes CWE-439 as a child of CWE-435 Improper Interaction Between Multiple Correctly-Behaving Entities and a member of weaknesses related to behavioral problems and component interaction. The document maps CWE-439 to the PLOVER taxonomy concept of "behavioral change" and notes it is relevant for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities.

Overall, the document covers an important weakness related to managing change across interconnected system components and how lack of change awareness can unintentionally introduce security issues. Careful configuration management, deprecation policies, and maintaining backwards compatibility can help mitigate risks from behavioral changes in new versions or environments.
