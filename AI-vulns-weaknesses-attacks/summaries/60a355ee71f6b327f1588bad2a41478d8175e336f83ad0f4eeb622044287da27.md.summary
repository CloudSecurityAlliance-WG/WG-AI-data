# Summary

The content describes CWE-560, a weakness related to improperly calling the umask() function in C code with an argument specified as if it was for the chmod() function. This can result in incorrect file permissions being set. The umask() function sets the file mode creation mask, which determines the permissions bits that are turned off/removed from newly created files. Some documentation wrongly states that umask() sets the mask to mask & 0777, making it seem like the argument enables permission bits like in chmod(). However, umask() actually sets the mask to ~mask & 0777, meaning the argument specifies bits to turn off. Using an incorrect argument can result in files being created with insecure permissions.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes CWE-560 weakness related to incorrect use of umask() function arguments in C code
* umask() sets the file creation mask, unlike chmod() which sets absolute permissions
* Some documentation wrongly states umask() sets mask to arg & 0777 like chmod()
* umask() actually sets mask to ~arg & 0777, with arg specifying bits to disable 
* Calling with wrong arg can result in insecure file permissions on new files
