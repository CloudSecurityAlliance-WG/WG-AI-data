# Summary

The text is from a website called PLOT4ai that contains a library of threats related to AI and machine learning. It highlights one specific threat regarding reinforcement learning (RL) agents and safe exploration. RL agents learn by taking actions in an environment to maximize rewards. During training, exploration is needed for the agent to understand its environment. However, some actions during exploration could potentially cause harm to the agent or environment. The site advises that if you are not ensuring safe exploration of RL agents, you are at risk.
