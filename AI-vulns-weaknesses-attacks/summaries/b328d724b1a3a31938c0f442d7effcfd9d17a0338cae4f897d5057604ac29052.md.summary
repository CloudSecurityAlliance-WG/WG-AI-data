Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-221 weakness describes a situation where a product fails to properly record security-relevant information, leading to incorrect decisions or hampering later analysis. This can be due to the information being truncated, omitted entirely, obscured by an alternate name, or misrepresented in the UI. Consequences include enabling attackers to hide their activities and tricking users into unsafe actions. Examples include not logging all failed login attempts, showing truncated filenames that hide dangerous extensions, and failing to warn users about dangerous document functions.
