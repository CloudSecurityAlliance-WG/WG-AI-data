Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of server-generated error messages containing sensitive information (CWE-550). When certain conditions like network failure occur, a server error message may be displayed. While error messages themselves are not dangerous, attackers can glean sensitive information from them to eventually cause problems. This weakness is a child of CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information. It impacts confidentiality by allowing attackers to read application data. Recommendations include designing consistent error handling mechanisms that provide meaningful details to end users without revealing information useful to attackers.
