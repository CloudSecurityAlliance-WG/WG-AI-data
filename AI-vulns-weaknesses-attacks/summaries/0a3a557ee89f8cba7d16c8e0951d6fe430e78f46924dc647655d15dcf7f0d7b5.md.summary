# Summary

The document describes CWE-183, a common weakness enumeration related to having a permissive list of allowed inputs in software. Specifically, it refers to when a protection mechanism in a product relies on a list of inputs or input properties that are explicitly allowed because they are assumed to be safe, but the list ends up being too permissive. This allows unsafe inputs to bypass the protection mechanism, leading to weaknesses that can be exploited. The key aspects are the overreliance on allowlists under the assumption they will block unsafe inputs, when in reality the allowlists end up allowing unsafe inputs through. This can enable attackers to bypass security protections by providing malicious input that is not blocked by imperfect allowlists.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-183 refers to permissive allowlists of inputs that are intended to protect software but end up allowing unsafe inputs
* It involves protection mechanisms that rely on allowlists of inputs believed to be safe
* The root issue is that the allowlists are too permissive and allow unsafe inputs
* This enables attackers to bypass protections by providing unsafe inputs not blocked by the allowlist  
* Can result in weakened access controls, exposure of sensitive data, etc.
* Static analysis tools can help detect some cases by analyzing data flows looking for unsafe inputs reaching sensitive code
* Mapped to weaknesses leading to bypassing of protection mechanisms
