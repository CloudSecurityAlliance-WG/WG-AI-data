Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an improper neutralization of special elements vulnerability that can lead to LDAP injection attacks. The vulnerability occurs when an application constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input without properly neutralizing or escaping special elements. This allows attackers to modify the intended LDAP query and execute unauthorized commands, read/modify sensitive data, or cause other unintended behavior. Common consequences include confidentiality, integrity and availability impacts. To mitigate this, input validation using an "accept known good" strategy is recommended along with neutralizing any potentially malicious input. Automated static analysis tools can also detect some instances of this weakness.
