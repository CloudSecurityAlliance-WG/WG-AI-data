Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an array that is declared public, final, and static in code. This is problematic because while the final modifier prevents the array variable from being reassigned, it does not prevent the array contents from being modified. Since the array is public, malicious code could potentially modify the array values. This exposes resources to an unintended sphere of access. The mitigation is to make the array private.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-582 describes an array declared public, final, and static which allows the array contents to be modified by malicious code
* The final modifier prevents reassignment of the array variable, but not modification of array contents
* Declaring the array public allows malicious code to modify the array values 
* This exposes the array to unintended access and violates secure coding principles
* The mitigation is to declare the array private to prevent unintended modification
