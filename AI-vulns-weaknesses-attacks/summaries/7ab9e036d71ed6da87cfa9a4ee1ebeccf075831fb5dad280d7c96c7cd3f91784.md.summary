Message:  # Summary

The CWE-397 weakness describes the issue of declaring that a method throws a generic Exception or Throwable in languages like Java and C++. This makes error handling difficult for callers of that method because they cannot anticipate and handle specific exception types. It is better to declare only specific exception types that callers should handle. Early C++ standards allowed functions to declare exception types they may throw, enabling them to declare broad exceptions like std::exception. This has the same negative effect of hiding potential exception types from callers.

* Obscures exception details and prevents callers from properly handling errors
