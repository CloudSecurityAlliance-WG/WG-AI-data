Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper validation of certificate expiration. Specifically, it refers to when a certificate's expiration date is not properly checked or validated, allowing trust to be assigned to expired certificates. This can enable spoofing attacks and compromise data integrity if malicious actors use the expired certificates to impersonate legitimate systems. The entry provides background on certificate validation, consequences of improper validation, and mitigations such as checking for expired certificates and validating all certificate properties before pinning.
