Message:  # Summary

Insufficient Session Expiration is a weakness where a website allows an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization. This can enable attacks like session hijacking or accessing private user pages by clicking the browser's back button after a user has left a public computer. The mitigation is to set short session expiration times.
