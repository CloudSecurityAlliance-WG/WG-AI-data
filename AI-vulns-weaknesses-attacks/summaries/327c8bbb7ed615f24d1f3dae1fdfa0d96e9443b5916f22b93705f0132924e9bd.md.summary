Message:  # Summary

The text appears to be from a website called PLOT4ai, which is a library containing threats related to AI/ML. The threats are classified into 8 different categories. The text discusses two specific threats: data leakage and concept drift. 

Data leakage is when model features contain information that can lead to overestimating the model's performance. This puts models at risk of not generalizing well. Concept drift is when the statistics of the data that models are trying to predict change over time, weakening model performance. The text warns that if you answer "no" to whether you are preventing data leakage, you are at risk. If you are unsure whether you are preventing it, you might still be at risk.

Overall, the text covers AI/ML threats related to data and concept drift, warning about the risks they pose to model performance. It aims to make users aware of these issues so they can take steps to address them.

# Summary bullet points

* Text is from PLOT4ai website, which contains library of 86 AI/ML threats in 8 categories 
* Discusses threats related to data leakage and concept drift
* Data leakage - model features contain info leading to overestimating performance
* Concept drift - statistics of data being predicted change over time  
* If not preventing data leakage, models are at risk of poor generalization
* Unsure if preventing leakage means still may be at risk
* Both issues threaten model performance
