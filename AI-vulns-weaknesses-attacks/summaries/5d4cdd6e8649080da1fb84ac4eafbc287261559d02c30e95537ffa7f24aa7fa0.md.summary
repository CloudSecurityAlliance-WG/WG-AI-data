# Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-1204 regarding the generation of weak initialization vectors (IVs) in cryptographic systems. It explains that some cryptographic primitives require IVs with certain uniqueness and unpredictability properties. If IVs lack these properties due to improper generation, the cryptography can be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs. Examples are provided of systems using predictable, duplicate, or constant IVs, allowing attacks like decrypting encrypted data. Mitigations advise following recommendations on proper IV generation for approved cryptographic modes, using unpredictable random IVs where possible.

# Summary bullet points

* Cryptographic systems require IVs with unpredictability and uniqueness properties to avoid weakened security
* Failing to properly generate IVs can allow attacks on the IVs themselves to break or weaken cryptography
* Examples are given of weak IV generation allowing decryption, like reusing IVs or using constant values
* Mitigations include using cryptographically secure random IV generation and checking IV uniqueness
