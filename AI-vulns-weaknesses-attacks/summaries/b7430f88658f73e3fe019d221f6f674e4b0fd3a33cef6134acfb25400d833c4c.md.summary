Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the provided data:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-676, a common weakness related to the use of potentially dangerous functions in software. Specifically, it refers to invoking functions that could introduce vulnerabilities if used incorrectly, even though they may also be safely used. Examples are provided such as strcpy() which can cause buffer overflows if the destination buffer is smaller than the source. The consequence can be security problems of varying severity depending on context. Recommended mitigations include identifying prohibited risky functions and replacing them with safer alternatives, or using static analysis tools to detect their use.
