Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-52, a weakness related to improper validation of path input containing multiple trailing slashes. This can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow attackers to access unintended files or directories. It is a child of weaknesses related to improper neutralization of trailing special elements and improper path equivalence resolution. The impact includes potential reading/modifying of unintended files. Mitigation involves validating and canonicalizing input paths.
