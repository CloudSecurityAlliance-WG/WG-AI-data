# Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of insufficient entropy in pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs with insufficient entropy can lead to stability and security issues. If the PRNG fails closed and runs out of entropy, it could cause the program to pause or crash. If it fails open, it could produce predictable random numbers that weaken encryption methods used for authentication. The likelihood of exploit is considered medium. Examples are provided of a JavaScript library falling back to a weak PRNG, reducing entropy and allowing duplicate crypto keys, and a security product with insufficient entropy in its PRNG enabling key discovery. Mitigations focus on using FIPS 140-2 approved random number generators, PRNGs that reseed themselves from high-quality sources, and understanding the entropy sources of PRNGs when selecting them.

# Summary bullet points

* Insufficient entropy in PRNGs can lead to stability and security threats
* Failing closed can cause program crash, failing open can produce predictable numbers
* Predictable numbers can weaken encryption like for authentication
* Likelihood of exploit is medium
* Examples of weaknesses leading to duplicate keys or private key discovery
* Mitigations include using FIPS 140-2 approved RNGs, reseeding, considering entropy sources
