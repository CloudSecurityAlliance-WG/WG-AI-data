Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of omitting a break statement within a switch or similar construct in software code. This causes unintended logic to execute, leading to unexpected application behavior. It provides code examples in Java and C demonstrating the issue. The consequences are altering execution logic and performing unintended actions. It recommends avoiding fall-through capabilities or clearly documenting intent if used. Potential mitigations include using if statements instead or documenting fall-through logic. The weakness can lead to critical code executing incorrectly. Automated static analysis can detect some instances.
