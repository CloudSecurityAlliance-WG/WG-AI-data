# Summary

The document describes CWE-341, a weakness where a number or object is predictable based on observations an attacker can make about the system or network state. This could allow unauthorized access or hijacking if used to generate IDs, keys for protection mechanisms, filenames for sensitive data, etc. 

It provides examples like predictable session IDs due to poor PRNG seeding, allowing session hijacking. Mitigations include increasing entropy for PRNGs, using FIPS 140-2 approved RNGs, and periodically reseeding PRNGs from high-quality hardware sources. 

The core issues relate to insecure use of randomness and predictability. This can enable various attacks if exploited, compromising confidentiality and integrity. Proper randomness and unpredictability are thus critical for secure system design.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-341 involves predictable numbers/objects based on observable system/network state
* Can allow unauthorized access or hijacking if used improperly, e.g. IDs, keys, filenames
* Examples: Predictable session IDs enabling session hijacking 
* Mitigations: Increase entropy and improve PRNG seeding/reseeding
* Core problem is insecure use of randomness, enabling confidentiality/integrity attacks
* Randomness and unpredictability critical for secure system design
