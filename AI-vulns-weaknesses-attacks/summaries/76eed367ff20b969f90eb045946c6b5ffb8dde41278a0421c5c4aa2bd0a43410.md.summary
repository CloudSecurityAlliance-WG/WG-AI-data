Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-87, a weakness related to improper neutralization of alternate cross-site scripting (XSS) syntax. It explains that the weakness occurs when a product fails to properly neutralize user-controlled input containing alternate script syntax, allowing attackers to conduct XSS attacks. The weakness stems from incomplete input validation or filtering that only works on lowercase "script" tags and fails to catch alternate capitalizations. Potential mitigations include resolving all input, carefully checking against an allowlist, output encoding, setting session cookies to HttpOnly, and writing data with filtering enabled.
