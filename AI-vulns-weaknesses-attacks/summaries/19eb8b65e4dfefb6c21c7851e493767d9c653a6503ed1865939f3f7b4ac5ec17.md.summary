Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1090 weakness describes a method in one class that directly accesses a member element from another class, indicating poor encapsulation. This makes the software more difficult to understand and maintain, indirectly reducing security by increasing the effort needed to find and fix vulnerabilities. It also potentially enables the introduction of new vulnerabilities more easily. CWE-1090 is categorized as an encapsulation issue that reduces maintainability. It is noted that this weakness is prohibited from use in mapping real-world vulnerabilities, as it is primarily a quality issue with no direct security impact.
