Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-796, a weakness related to only filtering special elements relative to a marker when processing input data. Specifically, it involves a product receiving data from an upstream component, but only accounting for special elements like "../" positioned at the beginning or end of a string. This fails to filter out other occurrences of those special elements that could enable attacks. An example shows Perl code that strips out "../" at the start of user input, but doesn't catch additional "../" strings later in the input that could be used for path traversal attacks to access sensitive system files. 

The key information security issues highlighted include:

- Failing to comprehensively filter all instances of dangerous special elements like "../" can enable path traversal attacks
- Input validation must account for special elements anywhere in the input, not just relative to markers like start/end of string
- This can allow attackers to bypass filters and access/modify unauthorized files or system areas

# Summary bullet points

* Describes vulnerability CWE-796 related to only filtering special input elements relative to a marker
* Involves product only filtering dangerous input like "../" at start/end of string
* Fails to catch other instances of those elements later in input
* Can enable path traversal attacks to access sensitive files
* Gives Perl code example that strips "../" at start but misses later occurrences 
* Those can be used to traverse file paths and access unauthorized areas
* Highlights need to filter all instances of special elements, not just by markers
* Input validation must account for entire input string
