# Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-601 - URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect'). This weakness occurs when a web application accepts user input specifying a link to an external site and uses that link to redirect the user, without properly validating the link first. This simplifies phishing attacks by allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites that appear legitimate.

The main consequences are that users may unknowingly provide credentials or personal information to attacker sites through phishing, allow malware to infect their systems, or have their interaction with the intended site monitored or altered by the attacker.

Defenses focus on validating redirection inputs, using allowlists of trusted URLs, adding intermediate confirmation pages before redirecting, and requiring nonces or unique IDs rather than raw URLs for redirects.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-601 is an input validation weakness where unvalidated external URLs are used for redirection
* Allows phishing sites to mimic legitimate sites when doing redirection 
* Users may provide credentials, PII, or be infected with malware due to malicious redirects
* Key defenses are input validation, allowlists for URLs, confirmation pages, and using session nonces instead of URLs for redirects
