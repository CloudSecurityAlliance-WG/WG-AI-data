Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-1043 describes a weakness where a data element aggregates an excessively large number of non-primitive sub-elements, which can reduce performance. The recommended threshold is more than 5 non-primitive sub-elements before it becomes excessive. This does not directly introduce a security vulnerability, but the resulting performance issues could make the system more vulnerable to attackers. The entry notes this is primarily a quality issue rather than a direct security problem.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1043 refers to a data element with too many (over 5) non-primitive sub-elements
* This can reduce performance and make the system more vulnerable to attackers
* It is considered an indirect security weakness and primarily a quality issue
* The recommended threshold is more than 5 non-primitive sub-elements
* The weakness does not directly introduce a vulnerability itself
