Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-841 describes the weakness of improper enforcement of behavioral workflow. This refers to when a product supports a user session where more than one behavior must be performed in sequence, but fails to properly enforce that sequence. By allowing actions to happen in an unexpected order or skipping required steps, attackers could manipulate the business logic or cause the product to enter an invalid state. This could allow bypass of intended restrictions, cause crashes, or enable other weaknesses to be exploited.

Examples are provided such as an FTP server that allows file listings or downloads before a user has logged in. The consequence is that authentication can be bypassed. A fixed version is shown that requires authentication first before allowing sensitive actions.  

Other examples demonstrate how skipping workflow steps could enable information disclosure or denial of service. Related weaknesses are discussed like CWE-696 Order of Operations, CWE-170 Improper Null Termination, and authentication bypass.

The entry describes how business logic and workflow flaws are an under-studied class of weaknesses often found in real-world systems. Testing and classification of these flaws is an open research problem.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-841 covers failures to properly enforce sequential multi-step workflows, enabling business logic bypass 
* Allows critical product behaviors like authentication to be skipped
* Consequences include bypass of access controls, crashes, exposure of unintended functionality
* Related to logic flaws, under-studied relative to input validation weaknesses  
* Examples like FTP servers allowing listings without first logging in, bypassing authentication checks
* Could enable resultant weaknesses like null termination errors or brute force attacks
* Fixes enforce workflow sequence, restrict behaviors until prerequisites met
