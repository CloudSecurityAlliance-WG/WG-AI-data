Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the provided information on CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information:

# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-223 describes the weakness of a product failing to record or display important information needed to identify the source or nature of an attack. This makes it difficult to determine if an action is safe and allows attacks to continue unnoticed. Examples of omitted information include IP addresses, failed login attempts, and full path names. This can enable attackers to obscure their activities. The weakness is caused by missing security tactics in system design and architecture. It can lead to information loss and insufficient logging.
