Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-425 weakness describes when a web application does not properly enforce access controls on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. This allows attackers to directly access resources through forced browsing without going through proper authorization checks. The consequence is often authentication bypass, path disclosure, or accessing privileged functionality. It overlaps with authentication errors, modification of assumed-immutable data, and container errors. It can enable subsequent weaknesses like XSS, SQLi, or remote file inclusion. Mitigations focus on consistently applying authorization checks before allowing access to any restricted resources.
