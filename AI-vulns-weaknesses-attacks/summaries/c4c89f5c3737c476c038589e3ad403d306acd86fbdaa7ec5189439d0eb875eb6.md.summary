# Summary

The paper presents a new gradient-based attack method to evaluate the robustness of neural network models against adversarial examples. The key ideas are:

1. Starting from an adversarial point far from the clean input, iteratively move along the decision boundary towards the clean input to find the closest adversarial example. 
2. In each step, an optimization problem is solved that estimates the optimal step towards the clean input based on the local geometry of the decision boundary.
3. The proposed attacks outperform state-of-the-art attacks across different norms (L0, L1, L2, Linf), models and attack scenarios in terms of success rate, query efficiency and reliability.

The attacks only require a single hyperparameter (the trust region radius) and are robust against suboptimal parameter settings. This makes the evaluation of model robustness more reliable compared to prior gradient-based attacks. The improved attacks have the potential to accelerate progress towards developing robust machine learning models.
