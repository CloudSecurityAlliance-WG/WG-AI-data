# Summary

The text describes CWE-131, an issue where software does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer. This can lead to buffer overflows or undersized buffers. Some key points:

- Incorrect buffer size calculations can happen due to math errors, incorrectly updating counters, not properly accounting for input transformations that increase size, etc.

- If the buffer is undersized, it can lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes, crashes, code execution, or data exposure. Overflows can also occur.

- The issue is prevalent and can be exploited, especially if the software runs with elevated privileges. It may enable full system compromise.

- There are various good mitigation techniques, including input validation, using safe libraries, ASLR, OS protections like NX bits, running with least privilege, etc. Static and dynamic analysis tools can also detect some instances.

So in summary, CWE-131 is a fairly broad weakness covering incorrect buffer size calculations with security implications. It can lead to serious memory safety issues and enables attackers to violate integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Proper secure coding practices are essential to avoiding introducing such flaws.

# Summary bullet points

* Incorrect calculation when allocating buffers can lead to undersized or oversized buffers
* Causes include math errors, mishandling transformations that increase size, parallel counter issues, etc 
* Can result in out-of-bounds access, DoS, code execution, data exposure
* Prevalent issue that is frequently exploited, especially with elevated privileges
* Static and dynamic testing can detect some instances 
* Mitigations include input validation, safe libraries, ASLR, sandboxing, least privilege config
