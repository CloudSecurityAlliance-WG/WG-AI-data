# Summary

The paper explores the possibility of creating adversarial examples that can fool machine learning systems operating in the physical world. The authors generated adversarial images for an ImageNet Inception image classification model and then fed these images to the model through a cellphone camera. They found that a significant fraction of the adversarial images were still misclassified when perceived through the camera, demonstrating the feasibility of physical adversarial examples. 

The paper tested different methods for generating adversarial images, including a fast method that adds noise and two iterative methods that finely tune the noise to specifically cause misclassification. The iterative methods were generally more effective at fooling the model but less robust to the distortions caused by printing and photographing the images. With the fast method and perturbation size of 16, around 1/3 of adversarial images remained misclassified after being photographed.

Further experiments tested the impact of individual image transformations like changing brightness, adding blur and noise, and JPEG encoding. While none of these destroyed 100% of adversarial examples, they caused higher destruction rates compared to printing and photographing. The findings indicate that the robustness of adversarial examples depends significantly on the method used to generate them as well as the type of image transformation.

Overall, the work presents strong evidence that adversarial examples can survive real-world scenarios like being captured by a camera. This poses potential security threats for machine learning systems working with images from the physical environment. Defending against such adversarial attacks represents an important area for further research.
