# Summary

The document describes CWE-1341, a weakness related to attempting to close or release a resource or handle more than once, without a successful open in between. This can lead to undefined and insecure behavior such as memory corruption, data corruption, or execution path corruption. Some common causes are error conditions and confusion over which part of code is responsible for freeing a resource. Potential mitigations include simplifying logic to only close a resource once, using a flag to track if a resource was already closed, and setting resource variables to NULL after closing. 

# Summary bullet points

* Attempting to close or release a resource/handle more than once can lead to undefined, insecure behavior
* Common causes include error conditions and confusion over freeing responsibility  
* Mitigations include simplifying logic, tracking closed status with flags, setting variables to NULL post-close
* Can result in memory corruption, data corruption, execution path corruption
* Applies to resources like files, network connections, memory, etc.
* C APIs often provide open/close functions prone to this issue
