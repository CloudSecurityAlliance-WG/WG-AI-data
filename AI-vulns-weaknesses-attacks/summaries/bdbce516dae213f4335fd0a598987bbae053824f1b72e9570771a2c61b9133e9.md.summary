# Summary

The content describes a weakness in the Struts web application framework where a form field is not properly validated. This can allow attackers to bypass protection mechanisms and modify application state in unintended ways. Specifically, if a Struts ActionForm contains fields that are not validated by corresponding validators in the validation framework, those fields could be manipulated by attackers. The example shows registration form code with email and phone number fields missing validators, allowing malformed input. The mitigation is to validate all form fields even if they may be unused. 

This is relevant to information and AI security as it demonstrates the importance of proper input validation in web applications to prevent unintended consequences from adversary inputs. Web apps that don't validate inputs can enable a range of attacks from changing application state to executing commands.

# Summary bullet points

* Struts web framework form fields should have corresponding validators 
* Unvalidated fields allow attackers to bypass protections and modify state
* Example shows registration form missing validators for email and phone
* Mitigation is validate all fields even unused ones to prevent issues
* Highlights need for input validation in web apps to prevent attacks
