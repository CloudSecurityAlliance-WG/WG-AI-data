# Summary

The content describes CWE-1422, a weakness that can expose sensitive information due to incorrect or stale data being forwarded to transient operations during execution in a processor. This allows an attacker to potentially read secret information over a covert channel. It arises from microarchitectural components like predictors, buffers, or out-of-order execution allowing incorrect data to propagate. Mitigations involve changes to hardware design, disabling problematic components, or using software techniques like serialization instructions. The key ideas are that transient operations enable side-channel attacks if they access incorrect data, and this weakness stems from flaws in forwarding stale values.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1422 stems from incorrect or stale data being forwarded to transient operations, enabling secret data to propagate
* Transient operations perform temporarily and don't commit state, but have side effects observable through covert channels
* Hardware features like predictors and buffers may forward stale values and cause exposure of secrets 
* Mitigations include hardware design changes, disabling predictors, or software techniques like serialization
* Arises when microarchitectural weaknesses allow incorrect data flows due to speculation or out-of-order execution
* Can violate expectations of memory safety and allow sandbox escapes
