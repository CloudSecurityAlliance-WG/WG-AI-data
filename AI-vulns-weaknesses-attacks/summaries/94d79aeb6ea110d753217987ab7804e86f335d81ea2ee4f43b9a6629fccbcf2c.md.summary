# Summary

The document describes an incorrect regular expression weakness (CWE-185) in software. It explains that when a regular expression used for filtering or validation is incorrectly specified, it can allow attackers to bypass intended restrictions on input data. Consequences range from unexpected program state to bypassing of protection mechanisms. Examples are provided of vulnerabilities resulting from unanchored regular expressions that allow additional data to be appended and bypass checks. Potential mitigations focus on refactoring to simplify complex regular expressions, extensive testing, and recording exploits to refactor regular expressions. 

The content covers information security issues related to improper input validation through regular expressions across software languages and contexts. Key themes include bypassing of protection mechanisms through malformed input enabled by faulty regular expressions.

# Summary bullet points

* Incorrect regular expressions used for filtering/validation can enable attackers to bypass intended input restrictions
* Faulty regular expressions have led to weaknesses enabling command injection, information exposure, denial of service 
* Consequences range from unexpected program state to bypassing of access controls
* Mitigations include refactoring complex expressions, extensive testing, monitoring production for exploits
* Improper input validation via regular expressions is a common cause of bypassing protection mechanisms
