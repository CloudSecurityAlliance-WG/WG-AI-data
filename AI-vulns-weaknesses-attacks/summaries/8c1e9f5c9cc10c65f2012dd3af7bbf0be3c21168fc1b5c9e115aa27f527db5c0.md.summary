Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness where code contains a function or method operating in a multi-threaded environment but owns an unsafe non-final static storable or member data element. This can prevent the product from running reliably and potentially introduce vulnerabilities if reachable by attackers. It is categorized as an improper synchronization issue and a concurrency issue. The consequence is reduced reliability.
