Message:  # Summary

The CWE-395 weakness describes the improper use of catching NullPointerException to handle potential null pointer dereferences instead of using proper programmatic checks. This is problematic because catching exceptions extensively can harm performance and does not address the underlying issue. The proper mitigation is to avoid relying heavily on exception handling for control flow and instead perform null checks before dereferencing pointers.

# Summary bullet points

* Catching NullPointerException should not replace programmatic null checks to prevent dereferencing null pointers
* Overuse of exception handling can reduce application performance 
* Catching NullPointerException merely hides the underlying problem rather than fixing it
* Proper mitigation is to perform explicit null checks before dereferencing pointers
* Exceptions should only be used for exceptional cases and not regular control flow
