Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1024 weakness describes when a software product performs a comparison between two incompatible types that cannot guarantee correct results. This can occur in strictly typed languages like C/C++ when a programmer assumes casting will ensure proper comparison, or in loosely typed languages like PHP/JavaScript where implicit casting may cause unexpected results. The consequence is a variability of technical impact depending on context. Suggested mitigation is thorough testing of comparison schemes with both positive and negative test cases before deployment.
