# Summary

The document describes CWE-1336, a weakness related to improper neutralization of special elements used in template engines. Template engines allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into messages or web pages. If input into a template is not properly neutralized, attackers could inject arbitrary expressions and perform injection attacks. Syntax varies by template language. Attacks could lead to cross-site scripting or obscure the root cause. Template injection can happen on the server-side (SSTI) or client-side (CSTI). The weakness is related to improper control of code generation and expression language injection. It can occur if the developer chooses an unsafe template engine or fails to use built-in sandboxes. Consequences include execution of unauthorized code or commands and impacts to integrity. Mitigations include choosing safer template engines and using sandbox modes.
