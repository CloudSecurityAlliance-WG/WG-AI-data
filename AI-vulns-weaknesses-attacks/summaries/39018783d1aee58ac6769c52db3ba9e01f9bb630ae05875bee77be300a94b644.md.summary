Message:  # Summary

The article describes the concept of single event upsets (SEUs), which are temporary bit flips in hardware caused by charged particles. SEUs can occur due to factors like cosmic radiation, especially at high altitudes. If SEUs occur in security-sensitive modules, they could enable privilege escalation or bypass protection mechanisms. For example, an SEU could change a regular user to have root privileges.

SEUs mostly affect SRAMs that store critical security data. To handle them, techniques like triple modular redundancy, error correcting codes (ECC), and address interleaving can be implemented around security sensitive modules and SRAMs. Failure to properly account for SEUs can lead to crashes, denial of service, or attackers gaining elevated privileges through unexpected bit flips.

# Summary bullet points

* Single event upsets (SEUs) are temporary bit flips caused by charged particles that can lead to hardware faults
* Cosmic radiation at high altitudes increases likelihood of SEUs 
* SEUs in security modules could enable escalation of privileges or bypassing protections
* SRAMs that store critical security data are most vulnerable to SEUs
* Techniques like triple modular redundancy, ECC, and address interleaving can help handle SEUs
* Failure to account for SEUs can cause crashes, denial of service, or privilege escalation by attackers
