Message:  # Summary

This article from MITRE ATLAS discusses the data vector of machine learning (ML) supply chain compromise for adversaries. It notes that data is a key element of any ML project and adversaries could target open source datasets or private datasets in the labeling phase to compromise them. Specifically, an adversary could rely on poisoning training data or injecting traditional malware into datasets. For private datasets, an adversary could modify the labels generated by labeling services hired to create the datasets. The key mitigation strategies highlighted include controlling access to ML models and data at rest as well as sanitizing training data.
