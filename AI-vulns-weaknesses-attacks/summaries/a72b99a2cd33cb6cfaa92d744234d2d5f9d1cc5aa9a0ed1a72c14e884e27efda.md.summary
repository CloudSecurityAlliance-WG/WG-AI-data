Message:  Here is a summary of the content on wrap-around errors in CWE-128:

# Summary

Wrap-around errors occur when a value is incremented past its maximum and "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value. This happens because computers perform addition by incrementing bits as if extra space is still available even when a primitive has exceeded its storage capacity. When primitives interpreted as signed wrap, they may take on very large negative values. 

Wrap-around errors typically lead to crashes, denial of service through resource consumption, data corruption, infinite loops, and potential memory corruption enabling arbitrary code execution. They are common in C and C++ code that performs insecure integer calculations.

Recommend mitigations include using languages not susceptible to these issues, providing clear bounds for protocols, and validating that incremented variables remain within reasonable limits.

An example shows vulnerable C code that allocates an image table without proper bounds checking, risking subsequent out-of-bounds issues. Proper validation of the table size calculation is needed.

# Summary bullet points

* Wrap-around errors occur when values exceed primitive storage bounds and "wrap" to invalid values
* Lead to crashes, denial of service, data corruption, code execution
* Common in C/C++ code with insecure integer math
* Mitigations: choose safe languages, provide bounds checks, validate calculations
* Example shows C code with potential out-of-bounds table allocation
