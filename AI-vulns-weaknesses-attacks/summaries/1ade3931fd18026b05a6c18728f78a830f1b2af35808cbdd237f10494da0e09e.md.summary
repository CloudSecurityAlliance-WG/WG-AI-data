Message:  # Summary

The document discusses adversarial machine learning (ML) attacks, where adversaries develop attacks specifically targeting ML models. It mentions adversaries may leverage existing attack libraries or implement new custom attacks against a victim model. Some key points:

- Adversaries can develop adversarial ML attacks to evade or confuse ML models used for security, like malware detection.

- They may build on existing attack code/papers or create new custom attacks tailored to the victim model. 

- Specific examples are given like evading botnet detection, bypassing an AI malware engine, attacking mobile app ML models, and confusing antimalware neural networks.
