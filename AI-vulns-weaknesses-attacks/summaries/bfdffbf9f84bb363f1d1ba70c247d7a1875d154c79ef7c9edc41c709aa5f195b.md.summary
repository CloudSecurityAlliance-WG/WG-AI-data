Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of using deprecated or obsolete functions in code, which suggests the code is not actively maintained and may have security issues. Reasons functions become obsolete include language advances, improved understanding of effective/secure operations, and changes in conventions. Using obsolete functions raises the probability of lurking security problems as software security has not been a historical priority. Examples are provided of potential vulnerabilities from calling deprecated functions like getpw() which can overflow buffers, or assumptions about system properties. Mitigations include referring to documentation on why functions are obsolete to determine alternatives, and considering security implications before using obsolete functions.  

# Summary bullet points

* Using deprecated/obsolete functions suggests code is unmaintained and may have security issues
* Reasons for obsolescence: language advances, better security knowledge, changed conventions 
* Raises probability of lurking vulnerabilities as security wasn't a historical priority 
* Examples: getpw() overflow risks, assumptions about system properties
* Mitigations: research why obsolete, consider security implications, find alternatives
