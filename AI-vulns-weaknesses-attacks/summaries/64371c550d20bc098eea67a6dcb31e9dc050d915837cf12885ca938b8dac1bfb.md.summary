Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the paper "Query-efficient Black-box Adversarial Examples":

# Summary

The paper introduces new methods for generating adversarial examples against neural network classifiers in restricted black-box threat models where the attacker only has query access to the model's outputs. 

The first method uses Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) to estimate gradients and generate adversarial examples with 2-3 orders of magnitude fewer queries compared to prior approaches. This enables attacks in situations with constraints like rate-limiting.

The second method generates targeted adversarial examples in a "partial information" setting where the attacker only has access to the top-k class labels and scores from the model. An optimization strategy is presented that perturbs an image of the target class to be misclassified as that target class. 

These methods are used to generate the first transformation-robust black-box adversarial examples using Expectation over Transformation, and targeted adversarial examples against Google Cloud Vision, a commercial computer vision API. This demonstrates the efficacy against real-world cloud APIs.
