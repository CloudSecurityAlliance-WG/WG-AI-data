# Summary

The document describes the CWE-698 software weakness called Execution After Redirect (EAR). This weakness occurs when a web application sends a redirect to another location, but instead of exiting, it executes additional code. This could allow unauthorized access or denial of service attacks. Examples are provided where attackers gained access to admin functions or performed attacks through EAR. The consequences include altered execution logic, unauthorized code execution, and impacts to confidentiality, integrity and availability. Recommendations include proper control flow implementation and scoping.
