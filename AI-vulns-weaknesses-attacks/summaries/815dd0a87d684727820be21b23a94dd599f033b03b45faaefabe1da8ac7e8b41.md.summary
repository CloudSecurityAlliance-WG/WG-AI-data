# Summary

The document describes CWE-219, a common weakness enumeration related to the storage of sensitive files under a web server's document root directory without sufficient access controls. This can allow unauthorized parties to access sensitive data if the web server permissions allow direct file access. It provides a description, extended description with an example scenario, relationships to other CWEs, applicable platforms, common consequences, observed examples from real-world CVEs, potential mitigations, CWE membership details, and taxonomy mapping information. The key points focus on the storage of sensitive data in insecure locations that can enable data exposure or confidentiality loss scenarios.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-219 refers to storage of sensitive files under a web server's document root directory without access controls
* This can allow unauthorized access if the web server permits direct file access 
* It is related to insecure configuration management and broken access control weaknesses
* Applicable to any platform and enables data confidentiality loss  
* Observed in real-world CVEs involving exposed user credentials, database contents
* Storing sensitive data outside the web root and proper access controls can mitigate
