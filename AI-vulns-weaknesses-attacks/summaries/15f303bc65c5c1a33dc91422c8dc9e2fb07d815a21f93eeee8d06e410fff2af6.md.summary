Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry provides information on CWE-140: Improper Neutralization of Delimiters. This weakness occurs when a product fails to properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes delimiters, allowing attackers to insert delimiters like field separators to manipulate input and gain unauthorized access or privileges. Consequences include unexpected application states and behaviors. Mitigations focus on strict input validation using allowlists and denylists, output encoding, and proper decoding/canonicalization of inputs.
