Message:  # Summary

The text is from the PLOT4ai library, which contains threats related to AI/ML systems. It discusses the risk of environmental phenomena like climate change or natural disasters negatively impacting AI systems by disrupting supporting IT infrastructure. Key points:

- Environmental changes and natural disasters can damage hardware and infrastructure running AI systems, causing outages
- Outages lead to delays, failures in decision-making, and taking systems offline 
- Climate change brings more extreme weather that threatens systems
- Floods, fires, quakes directly or by power loss disrupt physical infrastructure

So environmental risks pose a significant threat to reliable and robust AI system operations. Proper precautions need to be taken, like backups and failover systems. Geographic system distribution could mitigate some risk. But ultimately climate change makes all infrastructure more vulnerable.

# Summary bullet points

* Environmental phenomena like climate change and natural disasters threaten reliability of AI systems
* Can damage IT infrastructure and hardware running AI systems causing outages
* Outages lead to decision delays/failures and taking systems offline
* Climate change increasing hurricanes, fires, floods, heatwaves 
* Direct damage or power loss from quakes, storms, etc. disrupts physical systems
* Precautions like backups and failover systems warranted
* Wider geographic distribution could mitigate some risks
* But climate change makes all infrastructure more vulnerable
