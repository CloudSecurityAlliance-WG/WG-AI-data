# Summary

The text describes CWE-498, a common weakness in software systems related to cloneable classes containing sensitive information. It explains that cloneable classes allow objects to be cloned without running the constructor, which can bypass security checks performed in the constructor. This enables sensitive information contained in the class to be accessed by cloning the class. The text recommends making classes uncloneable by defining a final clone() method that throws an exception, or if the classes need to be cloneable, to ensure the clone() method is final and calls super.clone().

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-498 relates to cloneable classes containing sensitive data, allowing the data to be accessed by cloning the class
* Cloneable classes allow cloning without running the constructor, bypassing checks performed there 
* Classes should be made uncloneable by defining a final clone() method that throws an exception
* If classes need to be clonable, ensure clone() is final and calls super.clone()
* This can lead to exposure of sensitive information through cloning rather than proper access
