# Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper encoding or escaping of output (CWE-116) in software applications. It occurs when the application prepares a structured message for sending to another component, but fails to properly encode or escape the data, causing the intended structure of the message to be lost or altered. This allows attackers to modify the communications and insert malicious commands. Common consequences include unauthorized command execution, bypasses of other security mechanisms, and misinterpretation of incoming data.

The entry outlines various examples of improper output encoding leading to injection attacks like XSS, SQLi, and command injection. It stresses using input validation, output encoding libraries, parameterized interfaces, and understanding context when transmitting data between components as mitigations. Proper encoding or escaping is critical when software components communicate via structured messages. 

Overall, the content covers an important software weakness that can enable several types of attacks. It provides good technical detail and recommendations on preventing it through secure coding practices.
