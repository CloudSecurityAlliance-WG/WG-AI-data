# Summary

The text describes a heap overflow vulnerability (CWE-122), which is a type of buffer overflow where the buffer being overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, usually via functions like malloc(). This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. Heap overflows enable attackers to overwrite function pointers to hijack control flow and bypass security controls. They are prevalent in C/C++ programs and can be mitigated through bounds checking, environment hardening techniques like canaries, ASLR, PIE, or using safer functions. Chained with other weaknesses like signedness errors they can reliably lead to exploitation. Fuzzing is effective at detecting heap overflows.

# Summary bullet points

* Heap overflows overwrite heap allocated buffers and enable arbitrary code execution by corrupting control data
* Common in C/C++, lead to crashes, denial of service, takeovers 
* Can overwrite function pointers to hijack control flow
* Chained with other weaknesses can reliably exploit  
* Environment hardening like canaries, ASLR, PIE can help mitigate
* Use bounds checking and safer functions to prevent
* Fuzzing is effective at finding heap overflows
