# Summary

The paper explores adversarial examples against deep learning-based malware detectors, specifically the MalConv architecture. It evaluates different attack strategies like appending adversarial noise or modifying slack bytes in binaries. The effectiveness of attacks is tested on models trained on different sized datasets. Key findings:

- Attacks effective on small datasets may not generalize to robust models trained on larger datasets. For example, benign byte append attacks worked on a mini dataset but not on production-scale models.  

- MalConv is vulnerable to append attacks as it does not encode positional information. With enough appended bytes, adversarial noise can replace legitimate features during max pooling.

- Slack attacks modifying existing bytes are more efficient than append attacks. They achieve higher success rates while modifying fewer bytes by utilizing surrounding context.

- Single-step attacks generated for one model do not transfer to other models, unlike adversarial images.

# Summary bullet points
