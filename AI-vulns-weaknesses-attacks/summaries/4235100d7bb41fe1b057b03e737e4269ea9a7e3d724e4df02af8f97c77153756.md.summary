# Summary

The document describes CWE-46, a common weakness enumeration related to path equivalence vulnerabilities caused by improper validation of trailing spaces in file paths. This can allow attackers to access unintended file system locations and arbitrary files. Examples are provided of vulnerabilities related to trailing encoded space characters allowing source code disclosure. The weakness is a child of improper neutralization of trailing special elements and improper resolution of path equivalence. It can lead to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to read or modify files. Relevant attack patterns include adding a space to a file extension to exploit the trailing space weakness.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-46 involves path equivalence issues caused by lack of validation of trailing spaces (e.g. 'filedir ') in file paths
* Can enable attackers to access unintended locations and arbitrary files in the file system 
* Child weakness of improper neutralization of trailing special elements and improper path resolution
* Example cases listed where trailing encoded space "%20" led to source code disclosure 
* Enables authentication bypass and unauthorized file access
* Relevant attack is adding space to file extensions to exploit trailing space weakness
