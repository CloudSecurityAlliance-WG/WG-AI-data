Message:  # Summary

The document discusses the MITRE ATLAS technique AML.T0048.000 External Harms: Financial Harm. This technique involves the loss of wealth, property, or other monetary assets due to theft, fraud, forgery, or pressure to provide financial resources to an adversary. It is a subtechnique under the broader External Harms parent technique and is part of the Impact tactics. 

The document provides three case studies demonstrating financial harm:

- Camera Hijack Attack on Facial Recognition System
- Achieving Code Execution in MathGPT via Prompt Injection  
- Bypassing ID.me Identity Verification

It also lists four other related subtechniques:

- External Harms: Reputational Harm
- External Harms: Societal Harm  
- External Harms: User Harm
- External Harms: ML Intellectual Property Theft

The key points are that financial harm involves monetary losses to individuals or organizations through malicious techniques leveraging weaknesses in AI/ML systems. The case studies and related subtechniques demonstrate specific ways financial harm can occur.
