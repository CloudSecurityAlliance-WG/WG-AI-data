# Summary

The text describes CWE-1046, a common weakness enumeration related to the creation of immutable text using string concatenation operations. It explains that repeatedly concatenating strings in a loop to build up a larger string is inefficient compared to using a text buffer. While not directly a security issue, it can reduce performance. The text is an entry in the CWE list which documents software weaknesses that can become security vulnerabilities.
