# Summary

The text describes CWE-1173, an information security weakness related to the improper use of input validation frameworks. It explains that many coding languages provide validation frameworks to simplify input validation and prevent vulnerabilities. Not using these frameworks properly can lead to exploitable conditions if input validation is not performed correctly elsewhere. 

The main points are:

- Input validation frameworks simplify input validation and prevent common weaknesses like XSS and SQLi.

- Not using provided frameworks properly can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities if validation is not done right elsewhere.

- This can also hurt code maintainability since future developers may not recognize downstream validation.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1173 relates to improper use of input validation frameworks in code
* Modern coding languages provide input validation frameworks to simplify validation
* Not using these properly can enable exploitable conditions like XSS and SQLi
* Also hurts code maintainability as future developers may not understand validation
* Can occur at architecture/design phase by not leveraging frameworks
* Or implementation phase by not using frameworks correctly
