Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1120 weakness describes excessive code complexity, which makes code more difficult to understand and maintain. This can indirectly affect security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. It can also reduce performance and potentially introduce new vulnerabilities. Excessive complexity is quantified by standard metrics. This weakness is related to other more specific weaknesses like excessive lines of code, excessive nesting depth, and excessive attack surface. It is categorized as an issue that can indirectly enable vulnerabilities by reducing code quality. The mapping guidance indicates it can be used to map some real-world vulnerabilities, but careful review is required when doing so.
