Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry provides information about the weakness CWE-391 Unchecked Error Condition, which is related to ignoring exceptions and error conditions that could allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior. It is planned for deprecation in favor of more specific related weaknesses like CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value, CWE-248 Uncaught Exception, and CWE-1069 Empty Exception Block. The weakness can lead to unexpected state or behavior changes and alter execution logic. It is applicable across languages and platforms. The entry provides examples of the weakness in code and recommendations for catching all relevant exceptions to handle errors properly. It also maps the weakness to related weaknesses, secure coding standards, and taxonomies.
