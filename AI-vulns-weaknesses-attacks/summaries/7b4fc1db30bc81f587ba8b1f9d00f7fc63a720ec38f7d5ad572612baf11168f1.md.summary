# Summary

The paper explores targeted data poisoning attacks on neural networks, in which the attacker adds carefully constructed poison instances to the training data to manipulate the behavior of the model on a chosen test instance. The key aspects of the proposed attack are:

1) It uses "clean-labels", meaning the poison instances appear properly labeled to human observers rather than being maliciously mislabeled by the attacker. This makes the attack stealthy and applicable even when the attacker cannot control labeling. 

2) It is targeted, aiming to cause misclassification of one chosen instance without degrading overall performance. For example, manipulating a face recognition system to change the identity of a specific person.

3) An optimization method crafts poisons that collide with the target in feature space while remaining close to base instances in input space. Retraining causes the decision boundary to encompass the poison and target.

The attack is extremely powerful under transfer learning, achieving 100% success with just one poison instance added to the training data. In end-to-end training, the network's adaptability makes poisoning more difficult. However, "watermarking" poisons with a low-opacity target overlay, alongside using multiple diverse poison instances, leads to attack success rates over 50%.

# Summary bullet points

* Proposes targeted data poisoning attacks using clean labels, controlling model behavior on chosen inputs without performance degradation
* Crafts poisons via optimization to collide with target in feature space while staying close to base inputs 
* Poisoning forces retraining to alter decision boundaries to include target and poisons
* 100% attack success in transfer learning with just one poison instance  
* End-to-end training is more robust, requiring watermarking with multiple poisons for 50%+ success rate
