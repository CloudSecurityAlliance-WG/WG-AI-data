# Summary

The paper introduces the task of "model functionality stealing", where an adversary attempts to replicate the functionality of a victim machine learning model based solely on black-box access to the model (input images and prediction outputs). The approach involves: (1) Querying the black-box model to construct a transfer set of image-prediction pairs; (2) Training a "knockoff" model on this transfer set to imitate the victim model. Experiments across datasets and model architectures demonstrate strong performance, with knockoffs achieving up to 0.96× victim accuracy. An adaptive sampling strategy and analysis of the learned policy provides further insights. The attack also validated on real-world facial analysis API, constructing reasonable knockoffs for $30. Overall, the method poses a threat for deployed models by stealing functionality with minimal assumptions. Defenses such as truncating outputs are shown to be minimally effective.
