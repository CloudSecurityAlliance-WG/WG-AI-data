Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-143 weakness describes a vulnerability where a product receives input but does not properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as record delimiters. This can allow attackers to inject delimiters that cause unexpected actions during parsing. Proper input validation using allowlists and escaping/filtering of delimiters is recommended to prevent exploitation.
