Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes the weakness of excessive data query operations on large data tables. Performing queries with many joins and subqueries on large datasets can negatively impact performance. While the definitions of "large" and "many" are subjective, CISQ recommends considering tables with over 1 million rows as large, and queries with 5+ joins and 3+ subqueries as excessive. This performance degradation could make a system more vulnerable if reachable by an attacker.

The key impacts are reduced performance and increased vulnerability surface from reachable code. It is categorized as an indirect weakness that makes the introduction of other weaknesses easier. Relevant mitigations focus on efficiently querying large datasets and securing access to query functionality.
