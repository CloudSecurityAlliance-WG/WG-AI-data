Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of insufficient encapsulation in software design and development. It occurs when the internal representation and implementation details of data or methods are not sufficiently hidden, allowing external components or modules to modify data unexpectedly or invoke unintended functionality. This makes the software more difficult to maintain and insecure. Examples are given of a user account class in C++ that declares the username and password member variables as public instead of private, enabling unauthorized access. The key points are:

- Insufficient encapsulation exposes internal data and methods, enabling unintended access and modifications. 
- It violates secure coding best practices of information hiding and modularity.
- It makes software harder to maintain and more vulnerable. 
-Sensitive data like usernames and passwords should be declared private.
- Child weaknesses include critical data exposure, deep hierarchy invocation, and data access from outside expected components.
