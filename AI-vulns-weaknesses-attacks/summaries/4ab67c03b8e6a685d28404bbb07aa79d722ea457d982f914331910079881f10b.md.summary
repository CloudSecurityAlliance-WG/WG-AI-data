Message:  # Summary

The document discusses CWE-282, a weakness related to improper ownership management in software. Specifically, it refers to when software assigns incorrect or fails to properly verify ownership of an object or resource. Consequences can include attackers gaining elevated privileges or assuming other users' identities. The document provides examples in Python code showing improper and proper ownership checking when trying to kill a process. It notes that ownership should be carefully managed, especially in privileged programs that take user input. Static analysis tools can automatically detect some instances of this weakness. Ultimately, explicitly managing trust zones and verifying permissions is critical.
