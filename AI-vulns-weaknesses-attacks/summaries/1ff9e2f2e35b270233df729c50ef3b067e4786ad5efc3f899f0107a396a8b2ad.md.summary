# Summary

The CWE entry describes semiconductor defects that can occur in hardware logic implementing security-critical functions. These defects manifest as stuck-at faults that cause incorrect logic behavior. If such faults occur in hardware responsible for access control, encryption, authentication etc., it can compromise the security guarantees. The entry advises extensive post-manufacturing testing to detect faults and operating within device specifications to avoid introducing defects through use. 

# Summary bullet points

* Semiconductor devices can fail due to manufacturing defects or stress during prolonged use
* Defects manifest as stuck-at faults causing incorrect logic behavior 
* Faults in security-critical hardware logic can compromise security guarantees
* Post-manufacturing testing is critical to detect faults
* Operating within device specifications avoids introducing defects
