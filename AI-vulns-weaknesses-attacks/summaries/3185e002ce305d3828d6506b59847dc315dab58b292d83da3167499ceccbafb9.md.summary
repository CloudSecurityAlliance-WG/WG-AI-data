# Summary

The paper introduces label-only membership inference attacks that can determine if a data sample was used to train a machine learning model by only accessing the model's hard predicted labels, without access to confidence scores. The attacks evaluate the model's robustness to input perturbations like data augmentations and adversarial examples to extract membership signals. The label-only attacks match or exceed the performance of previous attacks using confidence scores. They are used to break defenses like MemGuard and adversarial regularization that aim to mask signals in confidence scores but do not prevent leakage through hard labels. Overall the paper demonstrates that defenses focused solely on obfuscating confidence scores are insufficient and that techniques like strong L2 regularization and differential privacy that reduce overfitting are required to protect against membership inference attacks using only hard labels.

# Summary bullet points

* Introduces first label-only membership inference attacks using input perturbations and model robustness to match attacks that access confidence scores
* Shows combining multiple strategies like data augmentation and adversarial examples improves attack accuracy 
* Demonstrates defenses relying on "confidence masking" remain vulnerable to label-only attacks  
* Finds differential privacy and strong L2 regularization are still effective defenses in the label-only setting by reducing overfitting
* Highlights need for defenses to prevent leakage through hard labels beyond just obfuscating confidence scores
