Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1286, a weakness related to improper validation of the syntactic correctness of input. Specifically, it refers to cases where a product receives input that is expected to comply with certain syntax rules, but fails to properly validate that the input actually conforms to that syntax. This can lead to issues like parsing failures, unexpected errors, or enable latent vulnerabilities. Examples are provided related to XML and IP address validation. Potential mitigations focus on input validation strategies to reject non-conforming input.
