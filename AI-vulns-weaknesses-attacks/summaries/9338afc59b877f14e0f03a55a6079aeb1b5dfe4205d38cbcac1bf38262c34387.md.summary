# Summary

The document describes CWE-127, a common weakness enumeration for buffer under-read vulnerabilities. Buffer under-reads occur when code reads from a buffer using indexes or pointers that reference memory locations before the targeted buffer. This can expose sensitive information or cause crashes. Buffer under-reads are a type of out-of-bounds read vulnerability and allow attackers to bypass protections like address space layout randomization to improve exploit reliability. An example vulnerability is provided where an HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read issue enabling denial-of-service crashes.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-127 describes buffer under-read vulnerabilities where reading occurs before a targeted buffer
* Happens when pointers or indexes reference locations before a buffer 
* Can expose sensitive data or cause crashes
* Type of out-of-bounds read weakness
* Bypassing protections like ASLR can improve exploit reliability 
* Example given of HTML converter enabling DoS via buffer under-read
