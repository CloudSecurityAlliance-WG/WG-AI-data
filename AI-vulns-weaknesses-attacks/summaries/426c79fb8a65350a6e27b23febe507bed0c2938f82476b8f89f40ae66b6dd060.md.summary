Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-44, a weakness related to improper validation of path input containing internal dots (e.g. 'file.name'), which can lead to ambiguous path resolution and unauthorized access to files or directories. It is a child of the more general CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence) and a parent of CWE-45 (Path Equivalence: 'file...name' - Multiple Internal Dots). The impact includes potential reading/modifying of unintended files. It applies across programming languages and can enable path traversal attacks. The document provides background on the weakness, relationships to other CWEs, potential consequences, and information on vulnerability mapping and taxonomy.
