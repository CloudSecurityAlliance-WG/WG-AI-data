# Summary

The document describes CWE-270, a weakness related to privilege context switching errors. This occurs when a product does not properly manage privileges while switching between different contexts that have different privilege levels or access controls. An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access or assume another user's identity. Mitigations include carefully managing privileges, explicitly handling trust zones, running with the lowest necessary privileges, and separation of privilege.
