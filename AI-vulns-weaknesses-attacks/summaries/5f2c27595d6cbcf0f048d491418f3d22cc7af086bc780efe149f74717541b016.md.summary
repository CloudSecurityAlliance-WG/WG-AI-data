Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the text:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-639, a weakness related to authorization bypass through user-controlled keys in software systems. It allows an attacker to modify a key or identifier used to access user data or records, enabling them to view or modify other users' private information. This can enable both horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' data at the same privilege level) and potentially vertical privilege escalation if administrative privileges are tied to the key value. Examples are provided such as guessing session IDs or tampering with identifiers used in database queries. Recommended mitigations include proper access control checks on every data retrieval operation, protecting key values from external modification, and adding encryption or signatures to make keys harder to misuse.  

Overall, the text highlights the security risks of relying on user-controllable values to manage access control without sufficient validation, and provides guidance to software developers on designing more secure authentication and authorization schemes resistant to tampering. Key topics related to information security include access control, privilege escalation, and data protection.

# Summary bullet points

* System allows users to modify identifiers/keys used for data access, enabling unauthorized access
* Attacker can view/edit other users' private data by guessing or brute-forcing keys  
* May enable horizontal privilege escalation (accessing others' resources at same level)
* May allow vertical escalation if key controls admin status
* Applies to web apps, databases, APIs that use observable keys for access control
* Recommendations: proper authorization checks, protect key integrity, add encryption
