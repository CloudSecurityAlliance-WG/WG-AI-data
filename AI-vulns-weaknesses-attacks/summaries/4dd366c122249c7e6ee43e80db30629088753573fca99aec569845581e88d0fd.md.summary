Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the text:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-1118, a weakness in software documentation regarding insufficient documentation of error handling techniques. It states that if documentation does not sufficiently describe the techniques used for error handling, exception processing, or similar mechanisms across multiple software layers, it can indirectly enable weaknesses or make them harder to detect. This is considered a quality issue rather than a direct security risk.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1118 is about insufficient documentation of error handling techniques in software
* Can apply to documentation at multiple layers - module, executable, code unit, callable
* Indirect weakness - quality issue that could enable vulnerabilities or make them harder to detect 
* Not a direct security risk itself
* Documentation should cover error handling thoroughly across software stack
* Derived from Common Quality Enumeration (CQE) effort
