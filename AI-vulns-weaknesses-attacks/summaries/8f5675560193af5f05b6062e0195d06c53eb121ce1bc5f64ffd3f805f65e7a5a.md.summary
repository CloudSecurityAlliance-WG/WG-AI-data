Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The excerpt describes the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique that adversaries may use to execute commands, scripts, or binaries on targeted systems. It explains that most operating systems come with built-in command-line interfaces and scripting capabilities (e.g. Unix Shell, Windows Command Shell, PowerShell) that allow interacting with and controlling computer systems. Adversaries can abuse these technologies to run arbitrary commands and scripts, which may be delivered through initial access payloads or downloaded from an existing command and control server. The commands can also be executed through interactive shells/terminals or remote services. Overall, the adversary aims to achieve remote code execution on the victim's system.
