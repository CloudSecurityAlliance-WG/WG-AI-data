Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-115 describes the weakness of misinterpretation of input. This occurs when a product misinterprets an input from an attacker or another product in a security-relevant way. This can lead to unexpected states or behaviors that may expose vulnerabilities. Specific examples provided include a product seeing a dangerous file extension in free text and disconnecting all users, or a product not correctly importing and processing security settings from another product. 

To detect this weakness, fuzz testing is recommended, which involves generating diverse inputs to dynamically invoke the code. This can reveal crashes, memory corruption, or other unexpected results that indicate bugs.

The weakness is considered relevant to software design and development concepts and can lead to integrity impacts through unexpected technical states. It is applicable to all programming languages.
