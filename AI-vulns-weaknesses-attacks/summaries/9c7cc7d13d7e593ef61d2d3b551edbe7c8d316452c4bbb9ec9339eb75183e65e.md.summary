Message:  # Summary

This article from MITRE ATLAS describes a machine learning supply chain compromise technique where adversaries compromise open source ML models that a victim organization may use for fine tuning. The compromise could be through traditional malware inserted into the model files, or via adversarial techniques that manipulate the model itself. The goals include initial access or implanting backdoors into systems that utilize the models. Mitigations focus on controlling access to models, validating models before use, and using code signing and secure distribution channels.
