Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an weakness where a product does not properly handle situations where the number of parameters, fields, or arguments with the same name exceeds the expected amount. This can lead to unexpected behavior or state in the system. It often occurs when only one parameter with a given name is expected, but multiple are provided. This weakness is related to improper handling of parameters in general and can play a role in multiple interpretation issues and HTTP attacks like HTTP parameter pollution.
