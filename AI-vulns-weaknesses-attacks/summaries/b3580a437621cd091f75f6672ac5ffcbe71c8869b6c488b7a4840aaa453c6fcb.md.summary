# Summary

The content describes a stack-based buffer overflow weakness (CWE-121), which is a condition where a buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. This allows attackers to overwrite security critical data on the stack to execute arbitrary code or commands outside the program's security policy. Common consequences include crashes, denial of service, and the attacker gaining full privileges of the vulnerable program to access sensitive information or bypass other security mechanisms. 

Stack-based buffer overflows often lead to arbitrary code execution which can subvert any security service. They occur in languages like C and C++ and can be introduced in the implementation phase. Potential mitigations involve compile-time mechanisms to detect overflows, using abstraction libraries, performing bounds checking on input, and avoiding dangerous functions. Runtime defenses like address space layout randomization can make exploitation more difficult.  

# Summary bullet points

* Stack-based buffer overflow overwrites security critical data on the stack to execute arbitrary code or commands outside the programâ€™s security policy
* Allows attacker to gain full privileges of the vulnerable program 
* Leads to crashes, denial of service, code execution, and bypassing of security mechanisms
* Occurs in languages like C/C++ during implementation phase 
* Mitigations include overflow detection, abstraction libraries, bounds checking, avoiding dangerous functions 
* Defenses like address space randomization can prevent reliable exploitation
