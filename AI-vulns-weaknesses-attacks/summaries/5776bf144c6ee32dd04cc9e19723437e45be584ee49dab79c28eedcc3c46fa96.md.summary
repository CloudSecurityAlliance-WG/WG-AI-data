Message:  Here is a summary of the key information from the text, formatted according to the provided template:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-430, a weakness related to the deployment of the wrong "handler" to process an object. This can occur when the wrong servlet, DLL, or other code module is called to process an object, resulting in unintended behavior. Examples are calling a servlet to reveal source code of a JSP file or automatically determining the type of an object even if it contradicts an explicitly specified type. Consequences can include source code disclosure, execution of unintended functionality, and unpredictable system states. Mitigations focus on performing type checking before interpreting objects and rejecting inconsistent object types.
