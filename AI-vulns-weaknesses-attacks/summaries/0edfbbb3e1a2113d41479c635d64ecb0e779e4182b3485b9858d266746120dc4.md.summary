Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-653 covers the weakness of improper isolation or compartmentalization in software products. Specifically, it refers to when functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels are not properly separated into compartments with restricted interfaces between them. This enables the exploitation of low-privilege components to gain access to higher-privilege components. The extended description emphasizes that weaknesses in lower-privilege code can be leveraged to do more damage to higher-privilege code if strong boundaries don't exist. 

Some key aspects highlighted include:

- Compromise of lower-privilege components can lead to privilege escalation if proper boundaries don't exist. 
- Administrative tasks often require root/admin privileges even if only a small subsystem needs access.
- Breaking privileges across modules with restricted interfaces helps mitigate this weakness.
- Closely related to improper restriction of excessive privileges (CWE-250).

So in summary, CWE-653 covers when privilege levels are not properly separated allowing vertical privilege escalation. Proper compartmentalization is needed to prevent this.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-653 refers to improper isolation or compartmentalization of different privilege levels
* Can enable low-privilege exploit to access higher-privilege functionality
* Closely tied to CWE-250 (excessive privileges)
* Administrative tasks often overprivileged due to poor compartmentalization 
* Mitigations include properly separating privilege levels across modules
* Restricted interfaces needed between modules of different privilege
