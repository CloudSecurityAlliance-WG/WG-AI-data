# Summary

CWE-268 describes a weakness called Privilege Chaining, where two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities or rights can be combined in a way that allows an entity to perform unsafe actions that would not be allowed without that combination. This can allow a user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or access rights of another user. An example is provided where an "OPERATOR" role that is intended to have less privileges than an "ADMIN" can reset an admin's password and take control of the admin account. Potential mitigations focus on properly managing privileges through separation of privilege, environment hardening, and using the principle of least privilege.
