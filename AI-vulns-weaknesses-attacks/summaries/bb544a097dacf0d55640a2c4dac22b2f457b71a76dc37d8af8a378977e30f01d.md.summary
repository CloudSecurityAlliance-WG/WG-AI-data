Message:  # Summary

Adversaries may create accounts with various services to target systems, gain access to resources needed to stage machine learning attacks, or impersonate victims. The MITRE ATT&CK framework classifies this technique as "Establish Accounts" (T1585). Two case studies are provided as examples: the camera hijack attack on a facial recognition system, and the ClearviewAI misconfiguration. This shows how adversaries can exploit accounts with services that utilize machine learning systems to stage attacks.
