Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-1313 describes a hardware weakness where test or debug logic can be activated at runtime, allowing an attacker to modify the intended behavior of the system. This could enable leakage of sensitive data or denial of service attacks. The hardware should restrict activation of test/debug modes to certain time windows like boot or configuration rather than allowing access at runtime.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1313 is a hardware weakness where test or debug logic can be activated at runtime
* This allows attackers to modify intended system behavior and access sensitive data
* Hardware should restrict test/debug mode activation to certain time windows, not runtime 
* Consequences include data leakage, denial of service, unauthorized code execution
* Mitigations involve limiting debug mode activation to boot/configuration rather than runtime
