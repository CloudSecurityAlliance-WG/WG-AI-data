# Summary

The document describes CWE-838, a weakness related to using the wrong encoding when generating output for a downstream component. Specifically, it discusses cases where the encoding used is not the one expected by the component receiving the output. This can result in incorrect decoding and interpretation of the data, potentially allowing attackers to modify the structure of messages or inject unauthorized code or commands. The mitigations recommend using context-aware output encoding, frameworks that provide encoding assistance, and protocols that explicitly state the encoding method.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-838 involves using the incorrect encoding for output sent to a downstream component
* The downstream component may incorrectly decode the data if the wrong encoding is used
* This could allow attackers to inject code or commands by modifying the message structure 
* Consequences relate to integrity, confidentiality and availability
* Mitigations include context-aware encoding, encoding frameworks/libraries, and explicit encoding protocols
