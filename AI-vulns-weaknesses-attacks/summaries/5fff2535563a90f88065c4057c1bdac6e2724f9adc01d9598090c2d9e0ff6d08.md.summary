Message:  # Summary

The document describes the CWE-29 weakness related to path traversal vulnerabilities. Specifically, it discusses how input validation issues can allow attackers to use "..\" sequences to traverse outside intended directories and access unauthorized files. The key points are:

- The "..\" sequence can be used to bypass path traversal protection that only checks for "../" by taking advantage of the alternate Windows directory separator.

- Input validation issues are the root cause, allowing unchecked input to be used in path construction. An "accept known good" input validation strategy is recommended to restrict inputs.

- When validating filenames, stringent allowlists should be used to limit the character set and number of "." characters allowed. Directory separators should also be excluded.

- Filtering mechanisms may be incomplete in blocking all dangerous characters. Decoding/canonicalization of inputs should happen before validation to avoid bypassing the filters.

# Summary bullet points

* The "..\" sequence can bypass protections against "../" traversal by using the Windows "\" separator
* Input validation flaws allow unchecked input to be used in unsafe path construction 
* An "accept known good" input validation approach is best to restrict inputs
* Use stringent allowlists for filenames, limit dots, exclude separators
* Filtering can be incomplete, decode/canonicalize input before validation
* Traversal allows accessing unauthorized files outside intended directories
