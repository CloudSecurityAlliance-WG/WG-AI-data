# Summary

The content describes CWE-129, a weakness related to the improper validation of array indices. Specifically, it discusses how software fails to properly validate user-supplied input used as an array index, which can result in reading invalid memory locations or crashing. Consequences include denial of service, data corruption, memory disclosure, and potential code execution. It provides detailed examples of vulnerable code in C, C++, and Java, along with secure alternatives. Preventative measures focus on input validation, environment hardening techniques like ASLR and DEP, and secure coding practices.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-129 refers to improper validation of array indices from untrusted sources
* Using bad input as an array index can read/write invalid memory locations 
* Typical effects include crashes, data corruption, memory disclosure, and potential code execution
* Shows examples of the weakness in C, C++, Java code and secure alternatives  
* Mitigations include input validation, ASLR, DEP, sandboxing, coding best practices
* Can precede memory corruption, buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads
