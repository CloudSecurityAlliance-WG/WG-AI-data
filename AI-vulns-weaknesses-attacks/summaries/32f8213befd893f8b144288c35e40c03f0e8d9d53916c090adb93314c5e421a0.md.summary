Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1068 weakness describes an inconsistency between a product's implementation and its documented design. This makes the product more difficult to maintain and indirectly affects security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. It also may enable the introduction of new vulnerabilities more easily. CWE-1068 is considered an indirect weakness that reflects poor coding practices rather than a direct security risk.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1068 refers to inconsistencies between a product's actual implementation and its documented design
* This inconsistency makes the product harder to maintain and secure over time
* It indirectly impacts security by enabling vulnerabilities to be introduced and making existing ones harder to detect 
* CWE-1068 is labeled an indirect weakness reflecting poor quality rather than a direct security risk
* The weakness reflects difficulties stemming from undocumented differences between design and implementation
