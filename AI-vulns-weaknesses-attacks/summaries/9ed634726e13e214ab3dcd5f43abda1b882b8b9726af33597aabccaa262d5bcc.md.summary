Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-687, a common weakness enumeration related to calling functions with incorrectly specified argument values. It explains that this weakness occurs when a product calls a function, procedure, or routine but the caller specifies an argument containing the wrong value. This can lead to resultant weaknesses. 

The consequences of this weakness are a reduction in quality and technical impact. It often occurs in rarely tested code since the wrong argument value can change the semantic meaning and lead to incorrect behavior. It can also result from improper variable assignment where the wrongly assigned variable is later used in a function call.
