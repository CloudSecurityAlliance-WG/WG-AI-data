# Summary

The document describes a weakness (CWE-1316) related to the address map configuration in hardware such as system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. It explains that protected memory regions containing sensitive assets can unintentionally overlap with unprotected regions, allowing an attacker to bypass access controls to parts of the protected region. This overlap can occur due to limited configuration options, misconfigurations, or dynamic remapping attacks. The consequence is that confidentiality and integrity can be compromised as memory can be inappropriately read or written. 

The key mitigations are to ensure isolation between protected and unprotected ranges during architecture design, prevent overlaps in firmware configurations, and validate protections through testing.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1316 refers to improper overlap between protected and unprotected address ranges in hardware
* Can allow bypass of access controls to parts of protected memory regions
* Caused by constraints, misconfigurations, or malicious remapping 
* Enables unauthorized read/write of sensitive assets
* Need isolation in architecture, prevent overlaps in firmware, test protections
