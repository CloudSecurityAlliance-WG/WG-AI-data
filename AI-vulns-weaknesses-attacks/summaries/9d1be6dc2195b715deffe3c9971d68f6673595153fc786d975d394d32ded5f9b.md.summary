Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-392 weakness describes a situation where a product encounters an error but does not provide an appropriate status code or return value to indicate that an error has occurred. This can lead to unexpected system states and behaviors. The weakness is applicable across languages and platforms.

Examples are provided of situations where functions return "OK" even when errors occur, including cryptographic and PIN verification functions. This can enable attacks and vulnerabilities by masking underlying errors.

The weakness can result in integrity issues and unexpected technical impacts depending on the context. Careful error handling and status reporting is needed to avoid introducing weaknesses.
