# Summary

The document describes CWE-260, a weakness where a product stores a password in a configuration file that may be accessible to unauthorized users. This can allow attackers to gain access to the password and the system or resource it protects. The weakness is caused by omitting proper credentials management when designing and implementing the system. It is applicable to any language and can enable attackers to gain privileges or assume identities on affected systems. Examples show Java and ASP.NET configuration files storing database credentials in plaintext. Potential mitigations include avoiding storing passwords in accessible files and storing cryptographic hashes instead of plaintext passwords.
