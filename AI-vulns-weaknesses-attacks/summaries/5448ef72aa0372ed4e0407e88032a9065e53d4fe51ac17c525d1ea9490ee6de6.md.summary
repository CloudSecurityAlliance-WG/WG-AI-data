Message:  # Summary

The document describes an issue called "Incorrect Short Circuit Evaluation" (CWE-768) which can occur in conditional statements in code. It happens when a conditional statement contains multiple logical expressions, and one of the non-leading expressions produces side effects. Due to short-circuit evaluation logic, those side effects may not occur, leading to unexpected program state after the conditional. This could expose information, crash the system, or allow attacker control.

The example shows code where decrementing the loop counter variable `i` produces the side effect of setting a user's privileges. But due to short-circuit evaluation, the last user's privileges don't get set properly. This allows that user to end up with admin privileges unexpectedly.

The mitigation is to minimize side effects in conditionals to prevent short-circuit evaluation from altering control flow incorrectly.

# Summary bullet points

* Issue called "Incorrect Short Circuit Evaluation" (CWE-768) happens in conditionals 
* Occurs when non-leading logical expression produces side effects
* Short-circuit logic skips those side effects, leading to unexpected program state
* Effects are information exposure, crashes, attacker control
* Example shows user privileges not getting set properly
* Last user ends up with admin privileges unexpectedly
* Mitigation is minimize side effects in conditionals
