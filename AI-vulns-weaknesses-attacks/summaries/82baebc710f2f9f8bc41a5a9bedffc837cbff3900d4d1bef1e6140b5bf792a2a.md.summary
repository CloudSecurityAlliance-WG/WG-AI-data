# Summary

The document describes CWE-836, a weakness related to the use of password hashes instead of passwords for authentication. It explains that some systems record password hashes and compare a hash provided by the client to the stored hash to authenticate users. However, this allows an attacker to bypass authentication by obtaining the hash and replaying it without knowing the actual password. The document advises that comparing a client-provided hash to a stored hash provides no more security than using unhashed passwords.
