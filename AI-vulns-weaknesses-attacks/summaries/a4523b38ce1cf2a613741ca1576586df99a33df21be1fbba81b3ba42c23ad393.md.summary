# Summary

The content describes CWE-107, a weakness related to unused validation forms in Struts applications. When developers remove or rename action form mappings in Struts, they often forget to update the corresponding validation logic. One sign this validation logic is outdated is the presence of unused validation forms. These indicate the code is poorly maintained and may make the application more vulnerable to attack.

The example shows a Struts registration form class in Java that previously had a phone number field that was removed. However, the corresponding validation XML still checks for proper phone number format, indicating outdated validation logic. Potential mitigations include removing unused validation forms to keep validation logic up to date.

Overall, the content covers keeping validation logic updated in Struts web apps, using an example of an unused validation form and explaining how this can degrade quality and security.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-107 involves unused validation forms in Struts apps when validation logic falls out of date after changes  
* Signs of outdated validation logic include presence of unused validation forms in code
* Example shows Struts registration form class that removed phone field but still has phone validation form
* Outdated validation logic indicates poor code quality and maintenance
* May make apps more vulnerable to attacks by exposing outdated code
* Mitigations include removing unused validation forms in validation XML files
* Content uses Struts validation form example and explains security impact of unused forms
