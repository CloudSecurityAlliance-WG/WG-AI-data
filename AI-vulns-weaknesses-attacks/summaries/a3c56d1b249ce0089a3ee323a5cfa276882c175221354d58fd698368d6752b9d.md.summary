Message:  # Summary

The document discusses the technique "Search for Publicly Available Adversarial Vulnerability Analysis" used in adversarial machine learning. It explains that adversaries will often search for existing research and implementations that identify vulnerabilities in models they are targeting for attack. This allows them to leverage prior work to develop effective attacks instead of starting from scratch. The document provides the technique ID, lists associated case studies demonstrating uses of the technique, identifies it as a reconnaissance tactic, and links to further details on adversarial ML attack techniques.
