# Summary

The text describes a trapdoor, which is a hidden piece of code that allows a user to access resources without going through normal security mechanisms. It is considered a weakness that can become a vulnerability. Specifically, trapdoors allow attackers to execute unauthorized code or commands and bypass protection. They are typically introduced during architecture/design or implementation phases. Potential mitigations include verifying software integrity before installation and closely inspecting privileged code areas like authentication. Detection techniques involve static and dynamic analysis of binary, bytecode, and source code. Overall, trapdoors enable attackers to improperly access confidential data and bypass access controls.

# Summary bullet points
