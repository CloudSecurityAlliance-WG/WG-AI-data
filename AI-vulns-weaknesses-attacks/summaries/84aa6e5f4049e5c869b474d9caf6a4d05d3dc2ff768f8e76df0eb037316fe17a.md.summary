# Summary

The paper investigates poisoning attacks against Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These attacks inject specially crafted training data that increases the SVM's test error. The key ideas are:

- An attacker can manipulate the optimal SVM solution by inserting specially crafted attack points, based on properties of the solution. 
- Finding an attack point can be formulated as an optimization problem to maximize an error measure, subject to retaining the optimal SVM solution.
- A gradient ascent strategy is used where the gradient depends on properties of the kernel matrix. This allows attacks to be constructed in the input space even for nonlinear kernels.
- Experiments on artificial and real datasets demonstrate that the attack reliably finds good local maxima of the non-convex error surface, significantly increasing the SVM's test error.

Overall, the work emphasizes the vulnerability of SVMs to data poisoning attacks, breaking new ground in optimizing such attacks for kernel methods. It highlights the need to ensure learning algorithms are resistant against adversarial training data.
