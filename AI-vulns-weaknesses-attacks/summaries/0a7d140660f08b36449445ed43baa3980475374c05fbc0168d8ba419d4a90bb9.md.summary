# Summary

The paper investigates the problem of embedding inversion, which involves reconstructing the original text from its dense text embedding. The authors frame this as a controlled generation problem, where the goal is to generate text such that its embedding is as close as possible to the target embedding. They propose Vec2Text, an iterative method that guesses an initial hypothesis and refines it over multiple steps by re-embedding and correcting the hypothesis text to bring its embedding closer to the target. 

Experiments show that Vec2Text can recover 92% of 32-token Wikipedia inputs exactly from embeddings of a black-box state-of-the-art encoder. It also recovers inputs reasonably well in out-of-domain datasets. When tested on clinical notes from MIMIC-III, it can recover 89% of full names from embeddings. The results indicate text embeddings leak as much private information as raw text, implying they should be treated with similar precautions regarding privacy.
