Message:  # Summary

This text discusses the need to offer a redress mechanism for users of AI systems that can adversely affect individuals. It states that for such applications, implementing a "redress by design" system should be considered, where affected individuals can request remedy or compensation. 

The text references Article 22(3) of the GDPR, which provides individuals the right to obtain human intervention in decisions made solely by an AI system, as well as the right to contest the decision.

The main point is that if an AI system can negatively impact users, then offering those users recourse is important. Failing to do so may put an organization at risk of violating regulations like GDPR or failing to properly address user needs and rights.
