# Summary

The text describes CWE-1114, a weakness related to inconsistent or non-standard whitespace styling in source code. It is considered an indirect weakness that makes code more difficult to understand and maintain. While it does not directly cause vulnerabilities, inconsistent styling could allow vulnerabilities to be introduced more easily or make them harder to detect. The text explains that CWE-1114 is related to the broader concept of poor source code style and formatting. It is prohibited from being used to map real-world vulnerabilities, as it represents a quality issue rather than a direct security risk.
