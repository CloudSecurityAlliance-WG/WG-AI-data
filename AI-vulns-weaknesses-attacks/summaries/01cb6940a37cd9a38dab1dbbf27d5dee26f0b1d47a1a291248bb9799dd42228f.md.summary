Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-648 weakness describes incorrect use of privileged APIs, where a product does not properly conform to the API requirements for a function call requiring elevated privileges. This could allow attackers to gain privileges by causing the function to be executed incorrectly. Key issues include failing to validate assumptions made by the API, not accounting for known weaknesses in the API design/implementation, and calling the API from an unsafe context. Consequences may include privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, or execution of unauthorized commands.
