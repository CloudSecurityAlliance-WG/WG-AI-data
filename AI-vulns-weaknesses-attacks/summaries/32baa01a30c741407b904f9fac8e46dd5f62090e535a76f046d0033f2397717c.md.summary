# Summary

The paper investigates membership inference attacks against machine learning models. Given a data record and black-box access to a model, the attack determines if the record was part of the model's training dataset. To perform the attack, an adversarial attack model is trained to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on inputs from its training set versus unseen inputs. The attack is evaluated against models trained using Google Prediction API, Amazon ML, and neural networks on image, retail purchase, location, hospital stay, and census datasets. Results show the attacks can achieve high accuracy, especially against overfitted models. For example, median attack precision reaches 94% and 71% on retail purchase models trained by Google and Amazon's services. The root causes, relationships to model overfitting, and mitigation strategies are analyzed. Overall, the paper demonstrates and quantifies how machine learning models can leak private information about their training data through prediction APIs.

# Summary bullet points

* Membership inference attacks determine if a given data record was part of a machine learning model's training set, using only black-box access to the model.
* An attack model is trained to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on training inputs versus unseen inputs.
* Attacks are evaluated against models trained using Google, Amazon, and neural network methods on image, purchase, location and hospital datasets.
* High attack accuracy is achieved, especially on overfitted models, e.g. 94% precision on a retail model trained by Google.  
* Overfitting is a key reason models leak membership information but model structure also contributes.  
* Attack accuracy relates to model generalization error and diversity of the training data.
* Differential privacy and regularization during training can mitigate the leakage but attacks remain robust.
* Results demonstrate and quantify privacy risks with machine learning prediction APIs.
