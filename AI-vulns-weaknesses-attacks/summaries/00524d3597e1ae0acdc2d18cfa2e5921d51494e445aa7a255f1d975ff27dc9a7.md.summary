Message:  # Summary

Integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. This can introduce weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control. Specifically, it can lead to buffer overflows, infinite loops, data corruption, and incorrect security decisions. Care must be taken to use appropriate data types, validate inputs, and handle edge cases to prevent integer overflows.

# Summary bullet points

* Integer overflow happens when an integer exceeds its maximum storable value and "wraps around" to a small or negative number
* This can cause crashes, infinite loops, data corruption, buffer overflows, incorrect security decisions 
* Caused by insecure coding practices like using inappropriate data types or failing to validate inputs
* Must use proper data types, check for integer boundaries, validate untrusted inputs to prevent issues
* Can be exploited to bypass security checks or trigger dangerous conditions like memory corruption
