Message:  # Summary

The text appears to be extracted from a website called PLOT4ai, which is a library containing threats related to AI and machine learning. The site has classified 86 threats into 8 different categories. The threats seem to be in the form of questions to assess if an AI system is at risk. 

The document repeats the same content over multiple pages. The key message is that APIs connect systems and can expose information about an AI system or model. Not properly testing or securing APIs can put an AI system at risk of threats. Companies should "red team" and penetration test their AI systems before deployment to identify risks.
