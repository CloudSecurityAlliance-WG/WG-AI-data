Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-117 describes the weakness of improper output neutralization for logs. This occurs when an application does not properly sanitize or incorrectly sanitizes output written to log files, allowing attackers to inject malicious content into logs. Consequences include compromising log integrity through log forging or injection, covering up malicious activities, skewing statistics, implicating other parties, and potentially executing unauthorized code that exploits log processing utilities.

Key mitigations focus on:

- Input validation - Assume all inputs are malicious and reject those that don't strictly conform to specifications. Check length, type, range of values, syntax, etc.

- Output encoding - Specify an encoding that can be handled properly by downstream components reading the output.

- Double decoding prevention - Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized before validation to prevent bypassing allowlists.

Proper log sanitization is critical for security logging and monitoring to protect integrity and support auditing.
