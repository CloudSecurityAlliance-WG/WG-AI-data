# Summary

The document describes CWE-830, a weakness related to including third-party web functionality, such as widgets or scripts, from an untrusted source. This introduces security risks as the external code runs within the domain of the host application and can potentially access sensitive data or take control. Even trusted third-party code poses risks if it gets compromised. This is common in web mashups using JavaScript includes. An example shows vulnerable login page code that includes a weather widget script that an attacker could modify to steal user credentials.
