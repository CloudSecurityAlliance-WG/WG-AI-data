# Summary

The document describes the CWE-103 software weakness related to incomplete validation method definitions in the Struts framework. Specifically, it discusses cases where a custom ValidationForm subclass overrides the validate() method but fails to call super.validate(), disabling the built-in validation framework. This exposes the application to various attacks through unchecked input. 

The background explains how the Struts framework relies on the validate() method to check form input against constraints. Subclass implementations must call super.validate() to leverage the full validation framework, not just custom logic.

The consequences detail how failing to enable full validation leaves applications open to attacks like XSS, process control, and SQL injection by not checking inputs.

The example shows a RegistrationForm subclass that overrides validate() with custom logic, but omits the call to super.validate(). A mitigated version is also shown that includes the necessary call.
