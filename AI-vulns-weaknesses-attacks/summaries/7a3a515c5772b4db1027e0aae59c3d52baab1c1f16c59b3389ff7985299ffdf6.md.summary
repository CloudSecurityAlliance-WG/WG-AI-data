Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a potential software weakness where a parent class has a virtual destructor method, but a child class does not have a virtual destructor. This can lead to reliability issues or even vulnerabilities like memory leaks if the relevant code is reachable by an attacker. The key points are:

- Not having a virtual destructor in a child class when the parent class has one can cause problems with proper destruction/cleanup.

- This may reduce reliability or even introduce vulnerabilities if the code can be reached by an attacker. 

- Specific vulnerabilities that could occur are things like memory leaks.

So in summary, the lack of a virtual destructor in a child class inheriting from a parent with a virtual destructor is a poor coding practice that violates expected conventions. It can lead to technical issues that reduce reliability or potentially enable security issues.

# Summary bullet points

* Parent class has virtual destructor, child class does not
* Can prevent proper destruction/cleanup in child class
* Reduces reliability 
* If reachable by attacker, could enable vulnerabilities like memory leaks
* Violates expected coding conventions 
* Technical issue that could lead to security problems
