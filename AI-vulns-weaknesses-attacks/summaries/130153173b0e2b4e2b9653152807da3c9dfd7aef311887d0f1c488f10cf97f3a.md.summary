# Summary

The content describes CWE-329, a weakness related to using a predictable initialization vector (IV) with cipher block chaining (CBC) mode encryption. This makes the encryption vulnerable to dictionary attacks when encrypted under the same key. The IV is supposed to be unpredictable to provide security against chosen plaintext attacks in CBC mode. If the IV is predictable or reused, identical plaintexts can be encrypted to identical ciphertexts, breaking CBC security. 

The document provides background details on how CBC mode works by XORing the IV with the first plaintext block. It describes how the IV is supposed to be unpredictable. It discusses the likelihood, impact, and examples of this weakness being exploited. Potential mitigations are generating the IV randomly or encrypting a nonce with the cipher. Automated static analysis can also detect some instances.

# Summary bullet points

* CBC mode XORs IV with first plaintext block and then XORs each successive plaintext block with previous ciphertext block before encryption 
* Unpredictable IV crucial for CBC mode security against chosen plaintext attacks
* Predictable or reused IV in CBC mode allows identical plaintexts to encrypt to identical ciphertexts
* Makes encryption vulnerable to dictionary attacks under same key
* Impact is reading encrypted application data if IV not properly initialized 
* Mitigations include random IV generation and encrypting nonce with cipher to use as IV
* Static analysis can detect some instances
