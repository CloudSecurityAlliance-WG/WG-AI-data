# Summary

The content describes the weakness of uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674) in software. Uncontrolled recursion occurs when a function calls itself repeatedly without properly controlling the recursion depth or testing exit conditions. This can rapidly consume CPU, memory, and stack resources leading to denial of service through resource exhaustion. 

In some cases, the over consumption of resources can expose sensitive application details like installation paths when the runtime kills the over-consuming process and reports errors.

Recursive functions should test recursion depth and have exit conditions to prevent over consumption of resources. Automated static analysis tools can detect some instances of uncontrolled recursion weaknesses by modeling data and control flow.

Increasing stack size may temporarily mitigate resource exhaustion but does not fix the underlying weakness. The recommended mitigation is to ensure exit conditions that will unconditionally be met to end recursion.
