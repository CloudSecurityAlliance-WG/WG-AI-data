# Summary

The document describes CWE-323, a common weakness enumeration related to reusing a nonce or key pair in encryption. It explains that nonces should only be used once per occasion to prevent replay attacks. If a nonce is reused, an attacker could intercept encrypted data and resend it to impersonate a user or execute unauthorized commands. The document provides code examples in C and C++ that incorrectly reuse a hardcoded nonce value when encrypting and sending password or command data over a network. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges by capturing and replaying this network traffic.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-323 refers to reusing a nonce or key pair in encryption, which should only be used once per occasion
* Reusing nonces can allow replay attacks where attackers resend captured encrypted data
* This can let attackers bypass authentication, gain privileges, or execute unauthorized commands
* Examples show code incorrectly reusing a hardcoded nonce when encrypting passwords or commands sent over networks
* Attackers could intercept and replay this data to impersonate users or execute arbitrary commands
