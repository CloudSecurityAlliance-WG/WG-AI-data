# Summary

The weakness CWE-267 describes a situation where a particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity. This can allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges or access sensitive information. Some examples provided include allowing debugging capabilities that expose sensitive system info without proper restrictions, allowing database access capabilities that enable modification of unauthorized data, allowing attachment to privileged processes, and configuring overprivileged roles. 

Potential mitigations include carefully managing privileges, explicitly managing trust zones in software, running code with the lowest required privileges, and isolating accounts with limited privileges that are only used for specific tasks.
