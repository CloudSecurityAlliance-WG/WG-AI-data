Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of relying on Java package-level scope for security. Java packages are not inherently closed, so code inside a package can be accessed from outside if distributed. This means data marked as package-private can be read or modified by external code. The entry recommends making data private, static, and final to protect it.  

# Summary bullet points

* Java packages are not inherently secure or closed to external access
* Code inside a package can be accessed if the package is distributed outside the Java framework
* Data marked as package-private can be read or modified by external code
* Recommends making data private, static and final to prevent access and tampering
