# Summary

CWE-469 describes an issue where pointer subtraction is used incorrectly to determine the size or length of a data structure. Specifically, it involves subtracting one pointer from another to calculate the number of elements, but if the pointers do not exist within the same memory chunk, the calculation can be erroneous. This can lead to out-of-bounds access, information exposure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. The recommended mitigation is to use an index variable to iterate through the data structure instead of relying on pointer arithmetic. 

Proper validation of index values derived from pointer subtraction is critical. Languages like C/C++ allow direct access to memory addresses via pointers, so care must be taken when doing arithmetic on them. Safer practices include bounds checking and limiting pointer use to constrain their scope and accessibility. Overall, this issue reflects the general problem of ensuring proper pointer use, especially when making assumptions about relationships between pointer values.

# Summary bullet points

* Issue arises from using pointer subtraction to determine size/length of a data structure
* If the pointers are not within the same memory chunk, the calculation can be wrong
* Can result in out-of-bounds access, information disclosure, denial of service, code execution
* Mitigation is to use index variable instead of pointer arithmetic to iterate and determine size
* Pointer subtraction assumptions about memory addresses can be erroneous  
* Need proper input validation when using pointer arithmetic
* Languages like C/C++ require caution with direct memory access via pointers
* Bounds checking and limiting pointer scope/accessibility improves safety
