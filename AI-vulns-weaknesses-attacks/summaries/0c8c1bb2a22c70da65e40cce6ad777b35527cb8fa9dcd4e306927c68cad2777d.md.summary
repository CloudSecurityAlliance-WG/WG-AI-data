# Summary

The paper presents a method for creating inconspicuous-looking textures that when displayed in the physical world, cause visual object tracking systems to become confused and lose track of targets. These "Physical Adversarial Textures" (PATs) are generated by optimizing perturbations to an initial texture using an attack method based on Expectation Over Transformation (EOT). Several adversarial loss functions are evaluated including non-targeted, targeted, and a newly proposed "guided adversarial loss". The effects of randomizing different scene variables during EOT are also analyzed to find practical attack setups balancing adversarial strength and convergence speed. The method is showcased in simulation and also transfers effectively to real-world tracking systems for cameras and robots. 

Key points:
- First demonstration of physical adversaries that fool visual trackers
- New concept of "guided adversarial losses" proposed, shown to enhance convergence and adversarial strength  
- Study of EOT scene variables highlights tradeoffs between attack speed and robustness
- PATs created purely in simulation transfer to fooling real-world person trackers
