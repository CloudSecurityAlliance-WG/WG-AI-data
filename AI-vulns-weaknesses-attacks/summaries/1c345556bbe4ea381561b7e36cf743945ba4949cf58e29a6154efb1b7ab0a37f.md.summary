The article discusses the use of the singleton design pattern in multi-threaded environments without proper synchronization. It explains that using a singleton pattern in this way can lead to race conditions where multiple threads create separate instances of the singleton object, violating the intent of the pattern. Specifically, if one thread is swapped out in the middle of constructing the singleton instance, a second thread may check, see null, and create its own instance. This results in multiple objects instead of one shared instance. The impact is loss of integrity if the code expects and relies on a single instance.

The mitigations suggest using thread-specific storage instead of singletons where appropriate, avoiding reliance on double-checked locking in Java, and properly synchronizing access to singleton instances to avoid race conditions. Overall, the key takeaway is that simplicity and care are required when using singletons in concurrent code to preserve the singleton guarantee while maintaining thread-safety.

# Summary bullet points

* Using singleton pattern without synchronization in multithreaded apps can cause race conditions between threads
* This may result in multiple instances instead of a single instance, breaking intent of singleton 
* Can happen if thread is swapped out while constructing instance, then another constructs separate instance
* Leads to loss of integrity if code expects single instance
* Mitigations: use thread storage instead of singleton when applicable, synchronize singleton access properly
* Avoid double-checked locking in Java for singletons
* Key is carefully applying synchronization to maintain thread safety with singletons
