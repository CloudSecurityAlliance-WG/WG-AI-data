Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-708 weakness describes a situation where a product assigns incorrect or unintended ownership to a resource, allowing that resource to be accessed or modified by actors outside the intended control sphere. This can enable privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or other impacts. The weakness stems from architecture/design or implementation phases. It is relevant to access control weaknesses and business logic errors. Known real-world examples include backups, installers, and managers incorrectly setting permissions on files, directories, or other resources. Potential mitigations include periodically reviewing privileges/ownership and using automated testing tools. It is applicable to all software/hardware platforms and languages.
