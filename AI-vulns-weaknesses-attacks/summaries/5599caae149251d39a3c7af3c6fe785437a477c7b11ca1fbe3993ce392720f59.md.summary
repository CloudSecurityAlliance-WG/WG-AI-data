# Summary

The document describes CWE-1249, a weakness related to application-level admin tools that have an inconsistent view of the underlying operating system. Specifically, it refers to cases where an admin tool that is used to manage parts of the OS does not accurately reflect the actual state of entities or resources in the OS. This discrepancy could allow attackers to hide malicious activities by inserting "ghost" accounts or resources that are not visible in the admin tool's view.

The extended description provides examples of how this could occur in systems with web or API-based admin interfaces. Attackers could leverage other vulnerabilities to insert hidden privileged accounts, modify user capabilities unseen, or delete logs of their activities. The weak architecture enables circumvention of access controls, accountability, and unexpected system state.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1249 refers to admin tools with inaccurate views of the underlying OS, enabling attackers to hide entities
* Discrepancies allow insertion of "ghost" accounts or unauthorized changes invisible to the tool
* This could enable bypassing of access controls, loss of accountability, unexpected system state
* Applies to web UIs, APIs, cloud, networking devices with separate management interfaces
* Attackers could exploit command injection or other bugs to create ghost accounts and resources
