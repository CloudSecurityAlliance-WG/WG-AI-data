Message:  Here is a summary of the key information from the CWE data:

# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry describes the weakness CWE-489: Active Debug Code. This refers to debug code being left enabled or active in a product that is deployed, which can create unintended entry points or expose sensitive information. 

Leaving debug code in place creates security risks because debug code is intended for testing/debugging purposes and falls outside normal operating conditions. It may allow attackers to gain access, control, or confidential information.

The severity depends on the specific case - it may expose settings/mechanics at a minimum or allow full control of the application and server at worst. Debug code could be used to bypass authentication checks. 

Static analysis security testing tools can potentially find instances of this weakness by analyzing source code for vulnerable patterns without executing the code.
