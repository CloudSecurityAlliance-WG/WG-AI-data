# Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness where a serializable class contains sensitive data but does not explicitly deny serialization (CWE-499). This allows an attacker to serialize the class through another class and gain access to private data. The example shows a PatientRecord class with private name and social security number fields that does not deny serialization. An attacker could serialize this class to extract the sensitive private data. The recommended mitigation is to explicitly define a final writeObject() method to prevent serialization in Java.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-499 describes serializable classes containing sensitive data without preventing serialization 
* Serializable classes allow data to be extracted by serializing through another class
* Example shows PatientRecord class with private SSN not denying serialization
* Attacker can serialize PatientRecord and extract private data 
* Define final writeObject() method in Java to prevent serialization
