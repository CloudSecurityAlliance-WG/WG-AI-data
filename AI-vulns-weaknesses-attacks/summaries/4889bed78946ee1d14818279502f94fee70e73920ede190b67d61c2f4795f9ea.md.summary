Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-84 describes an improper neutralization of encoded URI schemes in a web page, which enables cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability arises when user-controlled input containing executable script disguised with URI encodings is not properly neutralized before being displayed in a web page. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the web page via crafted input data. Some common consequences include unexpected changes to the web page state and execution of malicious scripts by site visitors. Potential mitigations include input validation, output encoding, setting HttpOnly session cookies, and attack surface reduction. Prominent real-world examples are provided, including vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server, Novell GroupWise, and insecure usage of BBcode image tags.
