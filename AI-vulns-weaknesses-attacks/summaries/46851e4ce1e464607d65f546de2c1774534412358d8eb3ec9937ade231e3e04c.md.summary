# Summary

The paper proposes a novel black-box attack method to fool deep neural networks by only modifying one pixel of an input image. The attack is based on using differential evolution, an optimization algorithm, to find the best pixel to perturb and the RGB values to change it to in order to alter the network's classification. Experiments were conducted using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and three CNN models - AllConv, NiN, and VGG16. Results show the attack can fool networks on 67-71% of CIFAR-10 images by changing just one pixel, with 74% confidence of misclassification on average. 16% of ImageNet images were also misclassified with 23% average confidence. The attack explores vulnerabilities of DNNs in an extreme limited scenario, indicating issues with robustness and need for improved defenses.
