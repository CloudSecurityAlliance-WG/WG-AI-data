# Summary

The paper introduces new methods for generating clean-label backdoor attacks on deep neural networks. Previous backdoor attacks relied on poisoning the training data with mislabeled examples that could be easily detected. The new attacks perturb images to make them harder to classify while keeping their original plausible labels. Two perturbation methods are proposed:

1) GAN-based interpolation to blend images towards an incorrect class in the GAN latent space. 

2) Adversarial bounded perturbations that maximize the loss of a model while staying close to the original input.

Experiments on CIFAR-10 show both attacks significantly improve upon a baseline clean-label attack. The adversarial perturbation attack generally performs better, especially for larger allowed perturbations. Analyses suggest this is because the adversarial examples better mimic real misclassified examples, causing models to rely more heavily on the backdoor trigger. Additional experiments reduce the conspicuousness of the trigger pattern and improve robustness to data augmentation.

The key findings demonstrate clean-label backdoor attacks can be made stealthier and more effective than previously thought. This highlights the need for defenses against such poisoning threats.

# Summary bullet points

* Previous backdoor attacks rely on suspicious mislabeled examples and are detectable
* New methods keep plausible labels while making images harder to classify  
* GAN interpolation blends images towards incorrect classes
* Adversarial perturbations maximize loss while staying close to original 
* Both attacks significantly improve upon baseline clean-label attack
* Adversarial attack works best, especially for larger perturbations
* Adversarial examples better emulate real mistakes so models rely more on trigger
* Reduced trigger pattern and augmented trigger patterns make attack stealthier
* Findings show clean-label backdoor attacks can be very difficult to detect
