# Summary

The document describes CWE-480, a common weakness enumeration related to the use of an incorrect operator in software. Specifically, it refers to cases where a programmer accidentally uses the wrong operator, changing the logic and flow of the software in ways that can introduce security vulnerabilities. Examples are provided in C, C++, C#, and Verilog showing assignments being used instead of comparisons, comparisons instead of assignments, and incorrect boolean logic using operators like AND and OR instead of the intended comparisons. The consequences can include altered execution logic and unexpected behavior. The likelihood of exploit is considered low overall, but can enable attackers to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges in some cases. Remediation focuses on careful code review, static analysis, and strict type checking to catch these kinds of errors.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-480 refers to the use of an incorrect operator, often accidentally swapping assignment and comparison operators
* Can alter logic/flow and allow unintended code execution or unexpected behavior
* Examples in C, C++, C#, Verilog are shown, often swapping = and == 
* Enables attackers to potentially bypass authN or gain privileged access
* Rated as low likelihood of exploit 
* Remediation via careful manual review, static analysis, strict type checking
