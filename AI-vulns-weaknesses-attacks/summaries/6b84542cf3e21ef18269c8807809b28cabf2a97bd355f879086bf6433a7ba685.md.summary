# Summary

The content describes CWE-393, a common weakness enumeration related to returning an incorrect status code from a function or operation. Specifically, it focuses on cases where an incorrect status code does not properly indicate an error condition, which can lead to unpredictable or unintended behavior in the system. Examples are provided of cases where a 404 status code is inappropriately returned from a Java servlet instead of properly conveying an I/O error. Consequences can include unexpected state changes, execution of unintended logic flows, null dereferences, certificate validation bypass, and more. The weakness can enable various follow-on exploits if critical security decisions are made based on the incorrect status codes.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-393 refers to returning an incorrect status code from a function/operation that does not properly indicate an error
* Can lead to unpredictable behavior if used to make security-critical decisions 
* Examples given of inappropriate 404 return from Java servlet instead of I/O error
* Possible consequences include unexpected state changes, unintended logic execution, null derefs, cert validation bypass
* Enables downstream exploits if used for security-critical purposes
* Fuzz testing is noted as an effective weakness detection method
