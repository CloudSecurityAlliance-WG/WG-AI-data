Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

Research labs and companies often have blogs highlighting their use of machine learning and its applications. These blogs, written by organizations or individual researchers, can provide practical details about machine learning systems, including underlying technologies, frameworks, APIs, and use cases. An adversary may search these blogs to better understand a victim organization's machine learning approaches and tailor an attack. Compared to academic publications, blogs tend to be more applied and may expose more implementation specifics.
