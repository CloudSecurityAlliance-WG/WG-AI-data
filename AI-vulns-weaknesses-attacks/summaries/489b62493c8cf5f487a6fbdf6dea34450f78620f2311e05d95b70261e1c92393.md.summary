Message:  # Summary

The CWE-239 weakness describes a failure to properly handle when a particular element in a request or data stream is not fully specified or is incomplete. This can lead to problems like resource exhaustion, unexpected application states, or denial of service. Some examples are not properly timing out or handling partial HTTP requests, leading to CPU and memory issues on a server. Proper input validation and checking for incomplete elements is important to avoid related problems.
