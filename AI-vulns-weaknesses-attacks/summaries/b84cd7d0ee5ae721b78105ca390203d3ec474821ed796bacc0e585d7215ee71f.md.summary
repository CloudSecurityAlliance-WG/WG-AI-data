Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-831 weakness describes a vulnerability where the same function is used to handle multiple signals in a program. This can lead to race conditions if the handler function uses any shared state or has side effects. An attacker could send one signal to invoke the handler, then send another associated signal to interrupt it and potentially corrupt shared state. Consequences range from denial of service crashes to bypassing of security mechanisms to privilege escalation or information exposure.
