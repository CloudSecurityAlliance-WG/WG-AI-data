# Summary

The content describes the weakness CWE-567: Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context. This weakness occurs when a product does not properly synchronize access to shared data across threads, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption. 

The extended description provides more details, explaining that within servlets, shared static variables are vulnerable because servlets are multithreaded. If an attacker can influence a shared variable used by multiple threads, one thread could modify the data to be invalid for another thread.

An example demonstrates the problem, showing concurrent requests in two threads incrementing a shared counter variable. Due to the lack of synchronization, the counter only increments to 1 instead of 2. Potential mitigations include removing static variables or using synchronized access.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-567 is unsynchronized access to shared data in a multithreaded context
* It can lead to undefined behavior, data corruption, crashes
* Common in servlets because they are multithreaded
* Example shows counter variable incremented by two threads but only reaches 1
* Mitigations include removing static variables or synchronized access
