Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the provided data:

# Summary

The document describes CWE-110, a weakness in the Struts web application framework where the validator logic does not match the actual form fields it is validating. This occurs when developers modify the form class but fail to update the corresponding validator configuration. The result is that validation rules may not be properly enforced or may validate non-existent fields. While this does not directly lead to vulnerabilities, it indicates poor coding practices that could result in issues like cross-site scripting, SQL injection, or process control vulnerabilities from unchecked user input. The document provides examples of inconsistent validator/form code and notes the importance of keeping them in sync. It suggests using automated or manual analysis of the XML validator configuration files to detect such inconsistencies.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-110 refers to a mismatch between Struts form fields and validator rules
* Caused by developers changing the form class but not updating the validator XML
* Leads to validation logic not being properly enforced
* May allow vulnerabilities from unchecked input like XSS, SQLi, process control issues
* Validator/form inconsistency signals poor coding practices 
* Critical to keep validation logic in sync with application changes
* Use automated or manual analysis of XML validator configuration to detect issues
