Message:  # Summary

The article discusses the weakness of having an empty synchronized block in Java code. A synchronized block is used to prevent multiple threads from accessing shared data at the same time. However, an empty synchronized block does not actually synchronize anything and is therefore pointless. It may indicate leftover code where synchronization logic used to exist but was later removed without removing the block itself. The consequences are that the code will still wait to acquire the lock, which delays execution, yet provides no thread safety benefits since no code is actually protected by the lock. It is an example of poor coding practice.
