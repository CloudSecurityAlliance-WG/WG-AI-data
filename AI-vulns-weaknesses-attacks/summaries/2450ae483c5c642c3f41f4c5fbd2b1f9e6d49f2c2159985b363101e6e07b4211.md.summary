Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness related to data elements containing pointer items without proper copy control elements. Specifically, it refers to code that contains pointers to data but lacks associated copy or constructor methods to manage that data. This can reduce reliability by causing unexpected behavior or crashes. While not a direct security issue, it could potentially be exploited to trigger crashes or unreliability. The entry categorizes this as an indirect weakness that makes it easier to introduce security flaws or makes them harder to detect. It is considered a bad coding practice that violates expected conventions.
