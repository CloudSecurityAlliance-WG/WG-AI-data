Message:  # Summary

Insecure automated optimizations refer to code optimizations done automatically, usually to improve performance, that can inadvertently alter execution logic or remove security checks, violating intended security assumptions. This can enable attacks like speculative execution or integer overflows. Examples include compiler optimizations that remove overflow checks, and hardware optimizations for branch prediction that bypass access controls. Mitigations involve reviewing automated optimizations and disabling ones that could violate security properties.

# Summary bullet points

* This can enable attacks like speculative execution and integer overflows  
* Mitigations involve reviewing optimizations and disabling insecure ones
* Specific examples include Spectre attack enabled by processor branch prediction optimization, and integer overflows from compiler optimization removal of checks
