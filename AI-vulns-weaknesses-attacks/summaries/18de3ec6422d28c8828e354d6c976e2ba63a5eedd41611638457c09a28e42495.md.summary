Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration entry CWE-1209 describes the weakness of failure to disable reserved bits in hardware designs prior to production. Reserved bits are intended for future capabilities and should not support functional logic, but designers may use them covertly for debugging or new features. This allows adversaries access to compromise hardware state if the bits are not disabled. The consequences vary by context but could enable unwanted behavior. Mitigations include features to disable the bits or blocking access to them.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1209 is about failing to disable reserved bits in hardware designs before production
* Reserved bits are meant for future use, not current functionality
* Designers may use them covertly for debugging or new features 
* Adversaries could exploit them to compromise hardware state
* Consequences depend on the logic controlled by the bits
* Mitigations include disabling the bits or blocking access to them
