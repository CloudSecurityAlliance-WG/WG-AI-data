# Summary

The text describes CWE-290, a weakness related to authentication bypass by spoofing. It occurs when authentication schemes are incorrectly implemented in a way that makes them vulnerable to spoofing attacks. This allows attackers to access resources and gain privileges they should not have access to without proper authentication. Common consequences include bypassing protection mechanisms and assuming a user's identity. Examples are given of relying on IP addresses or DNS lookups for authentication, which attackers can spoof. Recommendations include not relying on a single factor like IP address for authentication.
