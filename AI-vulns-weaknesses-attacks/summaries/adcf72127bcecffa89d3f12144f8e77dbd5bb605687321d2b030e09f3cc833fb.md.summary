Message:  # Summary

PHP applications can be vulnerable to file inclusion attacks if untrusted input is used to specify filenames for functions like require or include without proper validation. This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by including malicious files from remote servers or exploiting path traversal to access dangerous local files. Defenses include input validation, not using register_globals, limiting allow_url_fopen, and storing sensitive files outside the web root.

# Summary bullet points

* PHP file inclusion vulnerabilities can occur if untrusted input is used to specify filenames for require/include without validation
* This could allow remote code execution by including malicious files from remote servers
* It could also allow local file access by exploiting directory traversal weaknesses 
* Defenses include input validation, avoiding register_globals, limiting allow_url_fopen, storing sensitive files outside web root
