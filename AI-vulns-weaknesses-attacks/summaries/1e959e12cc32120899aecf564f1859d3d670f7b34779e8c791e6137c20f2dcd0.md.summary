# Summary

The document describes the CWE-162 weakness related to the improper neutralization of trailing special elements in input. It explains that if trailing special elements like backslashes or spaces are not properly handled when input is parsed, it can lead to unexpected behavior that results in attacks. For example, an attacker could exploit improper handling of trailing spaces to bypass authentication or disclose source code. The mitigations recommend validating input properly using allowlists and denylists, encoding output to escape special characters, and decoding/canonicalizing input before validation.
