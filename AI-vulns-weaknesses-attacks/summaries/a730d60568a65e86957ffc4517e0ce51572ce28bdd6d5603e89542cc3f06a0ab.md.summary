Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is the summary and analysis:

# Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of a Struts form bean not extending the Validator framework's ActionForm subclass. This fails to leverage the input validation capabilities of the Struts Validator and leaves the application vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection. To fix this, Struts form beans should extend ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorForm or DynaValidatorActionForm to enable default and custom validation of input data.

# Summary bullet points

* Struts form beans should extend a Validation Class like ValidatorForm to enable input validation capabilities
* Failing to extend a Validation Class leaves app vulnerable to XSS, process control, SQLi attacks 
* Validation Classes provide default validation and custom validate() method for beans
* Extending ActionForm fails to leverage Struts Validator for input sanitization
