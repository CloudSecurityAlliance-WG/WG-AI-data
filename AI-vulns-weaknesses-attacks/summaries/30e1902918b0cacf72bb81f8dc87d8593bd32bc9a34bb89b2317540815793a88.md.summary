Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper neutralization of formula elements in CSV files (CWE-1236). When user-provided data is exported to a CSV file and opened in a spreadsheet program, entries starting with '=' are interpreted as formulas and executed. Attackers can exploit this to exfiltrate data or execute malicious commands when the CSV file is opened. The mitigations suggest properly escaping or removing risky formula characters like '=', '+', '-' from data before exporting to CSV, prepending formulas with ' to prevent execution in Excel, or configuring spreadsheet programs to disallow formula execution from untrusted files.
