Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-408 weakness describes a vulnerability where a product allows an entity to perform a legitimate but expensive operation before authentication or authorization has taken place. This can lead to amplification attacks that consume significant system resources like CPU and memory, potentially causing denial of service through resource exhaustion or system crashes. The key aspects relating to information and AI security are:

- Performing resource-intensive operations prior to authentication enables amplification attacks
- Failing to check authorization before expensive tasks risks denial of service through resource consumption 
- Ordering issues like this can allow malicious entities to trigger unintended behavior
- Careful validation of identities and permissions is critical before permitting impactful actions

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-408 involves performing expensive tasks before authentication, enabling amplification attacks
* Can quickly consume CPU, memory, and other system resources
* Leads to denial of service through resource exhaustion or crashes
* Failing to check authorization before expensive operations is the core issue
* Ordering problem - validation and checks must come before impactful actions
* Enables malicious entities to trigger unintended behavior through ordering error
* Stresses the need for careful identity and permission verification first
