# Summary

The content describes a hardware weakness called CWE-1264: Hardware Logic with Insecure De-Synchronization between Control and Data Channels. This refers to bugs in hardware logic that handles errors and security checks, which can allow data to be forwarded before completion of the checks. This can lead to loss of data confidentiality if the data reaches a location observable by an attacker. An example is the Meltdown attack, where data marked as privileged was returned to the CPU before permission checks completed, allowing access to secret data. 

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1264 is a hardware weakness where logic incorrectly forwards data before security checks complete
* Can happen in high-performance on-chip protocols with separate control and data channels 
* Bugs can allow data to reach locations observable by an attacker, violating confidentiality 
* Meltdown attack demonstrated this by accessing privileged memory before permission checks completed
* Logic should verify data routing to ensure security checks effectively block illegal data flows
