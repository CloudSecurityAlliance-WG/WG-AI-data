Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an incorrect chaining or granularity of debug components vulnerability that can occur in hardware such as system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. Debug components like test access ports (TAPs) are often implemented in hardware for testing and troubleshooting. If there is incorrect chaining between these debug components or improper granularity of access controls, attackers may be able to gain unintended access and privileges to execute unauthorized commands or access protected memory and firmware. Consequences range from gaining privileges, bypassing protections, and modifying memory or files. Potential mitigations include ensuring debug components have proper chaining and granularity of access controls at different authorization levels during implementation.

# Summary bullet points

* Incorrect chaining or granularity of hardware debug components like test access ports (TAPs) can allow unintended access
* Attacker can exploit this to gain privileges, bypass protections, and modify protected memory/firmware
* Consequences include gaining privileges, bypassing protection mechanisms, executing unauthorized commands, and modifying memory/files
* Mitigations include implementing proper chaining and granularity of access controls for debug components
