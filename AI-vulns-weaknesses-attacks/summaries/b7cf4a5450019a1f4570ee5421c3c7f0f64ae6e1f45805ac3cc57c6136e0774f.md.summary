# Summary

This document describes CWE-409, a common weakness related to the improper handling of highly compressed data, which can lead to data amplification attacks. When a compressed input with a very high compression ratio is decompressed, it can produce a large output that consumes significant system resources like CPU, memory, and storage. This is known as a "decompression bomb." An example is a very small ZIP file that uncompresses into gigabytes of data, overwhelming the system. If not properly handled, this can lead to denial of service through resource exhaustion or system crashes. Proper input validation and sanitization is needed to restrict compressed inputs to reasonable sizes.
