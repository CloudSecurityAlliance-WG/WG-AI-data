Message:  # Summary

The document discusses CWE-144, a weakness related to improper neutralization of line delimiters. Specifically, it covers how input from an upstream component may not properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as line delimiters when sent to a downstream component. This can allow injected/absent/malformed delimiters to cause unexpected actions during parsing. It provides examples of potential consequences like unexpected states. The document then suggests mitigations like input validation, output encoding, quoting arguments, and decoding/canonicalizing inputs before validation.
