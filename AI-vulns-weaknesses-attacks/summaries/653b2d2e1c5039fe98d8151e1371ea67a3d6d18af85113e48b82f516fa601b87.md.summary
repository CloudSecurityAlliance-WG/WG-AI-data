Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-157, a weakness related to the failure to properly sanitize paired delimiters like brackets, quotes, and parentheses in input. This can lead to crashes, buffer overflows, or unexpected system states if malicious input is able to manipulate or inject unmatched delimiters. It provides examples of past vulnerabilities related to unmatched delimiters, potential mitigations like input validation and output encoding, and related taxonomy mappings. The key points focus on anticipating delimiter injection, denying bad input, validating good input against specifications, encoding output properly, and canonicalizing input.

# Summary bullet points
