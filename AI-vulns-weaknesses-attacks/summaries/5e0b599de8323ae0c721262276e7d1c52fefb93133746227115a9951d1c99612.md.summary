Message:  # Summary

The text describes a technique that adversaries can use to obtain detailed information about machine learning research in order to reproduce or exploit the research. It explains that many publications detailing machine learning approaches are accepted at top conferences and journals, some of which are open access while others require payment or membership. These publications often describe the full technical details of approaches to ensure reproducibility. Adversaries can use this information published in journals and at conferences to implement the machine learning systems described in the papers for malicious purposes. The key ideas are that academic ML publications frequently contain enough implementation details for reproducibility, and that adversaries can take advantage of this openness to access and weaponize cutting edge machine learning research.

# Summary bullet points

* Many top machine learning conferences and journals publish detailed technical papers from commercial labs
* Some publications are open access, others require payment or membership to access 
* Papers typically describe approaches thoroughly to ensure reproducibility
* Adversaries can use publication details to implement machine learning systems described
* This allows adversaries to weaponize the latest machine learning research
