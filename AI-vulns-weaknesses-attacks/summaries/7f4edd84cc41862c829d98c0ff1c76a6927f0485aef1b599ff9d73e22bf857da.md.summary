# Summary

The CWE entry describes a path traversal weakness where a product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be restricted, but fails to properly handle ".../...//" sequences that can traverse outside the intended directory. This allows attackers to access files or directories outside the restricted area. The ".../...//" manipulation exploits products that filter "../" sequences in a sequential way, resulting in "../" after filtering. Input validation is recommended, specifically whitelisting inputs, restricting characters/extensions, and not solely relying on filtering.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-35 involves path traversal via ".../...//" sequences that bypass some protection mechanisms
* Occurs when external input constructs restricted pathnames but fails to neutralize ".../...//" 
* Allows accessing files/directories outside intended restricted directory
* ".../...//" can bypass filters that remove "../" sequentially, collapsing to "../" after filtering
* Input validation recommended - whitelisting, restrict characters/extensions, don't rely solely on filtering
