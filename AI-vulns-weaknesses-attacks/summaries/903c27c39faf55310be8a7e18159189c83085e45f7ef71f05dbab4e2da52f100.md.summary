# Summary

The text describes CWE-1303, a weakness related to non-transparent sharing of microarchitectural resources. Modern processors use techniques like caching and speculation to improve performance, but details are hidden from programmers. Sharing resources across contexts opens covert channels to leak information between contexts. Examples of shared resources used this way are caches, branch predictors, and load/store buffers. Speculation and out-of-order execution give attackers more control over leaked data. Undocumented resource sharing makes it extremely difficult to protect assets. Microarchitectural side channels have leaked cryptographic keys, ASLR offsets, and arbitrary memory. Mitigations involve hardware and software techniques like partitioned caches, new instructions, and disabling high-resolution timers. As of CWE 4.9, the CWE Hardware SIG is further analyzing hardware weaknesses like this, especially related to transient execution attacks. The entry may change significantly in CWE 4.10 as a result.
