Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the CWE data:

# Summary

The CWE data describes CWE-833: Deadlock, which is a weakness where multiple threads or executable segments are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock. This prevents tasks from completing and can lead to denial of service through resource consumption or system crashes. Examples are provided of deadlocks in operating systems, web servers, device drivers, and other software. The data maps CWE-833 to related weaknesses, quality measures, attack patterns, and secure coding standards. It is categorized under concurrency issues and resource locking problems.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-833 describes a software weakness called Deadlock where threads wait for each other's locks, preventing progress

* Gives examples of deadlocks in OSes, web servers, drivers, libraries, other code
* ChildOf the weakness Improper Locking (CWE-667)  
* Mapped to CAPEC attack pattern Forced Deadlock
* Part of categories for concurrency issues and resource locking problems
* Relevant to secure coding standards, quality measures
