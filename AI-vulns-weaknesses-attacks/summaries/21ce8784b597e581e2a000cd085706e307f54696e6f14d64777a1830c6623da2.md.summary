# Summary

The text describes CWE-1113, a weakness related to inappropriate comment style in source code. Specifically, it refers to code that uses inconsistent comment formats or styles that do not follow expected standards. This makes the code more difficult to maintain and read, which can indirectly introduce vulnerabilities by making it harder to find and fix security issues. The weakness is considered an indirect software quality issue rather than a direct security vulnerability. It is prohibited from being used to map real-world vulnerabilities.
