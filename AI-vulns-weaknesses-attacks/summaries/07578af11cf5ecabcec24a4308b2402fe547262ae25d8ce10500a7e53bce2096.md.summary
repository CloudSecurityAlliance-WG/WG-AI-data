Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the content:

# Summary

The content describes the security weakness caused by using inner classes in Java code. Inner classes get translated into peer classes at the bytecode level which have package-level access to the enclosing class. This allows inner classes to access private members of the enclosing class, potentially exposing sensitive data. Solutions include using static, local, or anonymous inner classes to restrict exposure, or avoiding inner classes altogether. 

# Summary bullet points

* Inner classes in Java can access private members of enclosing classes at bytecode level due to translation process
* This exposes private data and breaches encapsulation 
* Static, local, or anonymous inner classes can prevent exposure 
* Avoid using inner classes that access sensitive data in enclosing classes
