Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness where code contains a class instance that calls a method or function to delete or destroy itself (e.g. using "delete this" in C++). This can reduce reliability of the product, and if reachable by an attacker, could introduce a vulnerability. It is considered a quality issue with indirect security implications.
