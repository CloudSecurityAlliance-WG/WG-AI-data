# Summary

The weakness describes the use of a cryptographic hash function that is not cryptographically strong enough to resist attacks that allow an adversary to determine the original input or find inputs that produce the same hash. This makes it weaker than expected for security purposes. Specifically, it does not prevent preimage attacks, second preimage attacks, or birthday attacks within a reasonable amount of attacks. Examples are provided such as SHA-1 and MD5, which have known weaknesses that enable some of these attacks. Using hashes without salts for password storage is also mentioned as a problem. The consequences enable attackers to more easily bypass protections through cryptographic weaknesses.
