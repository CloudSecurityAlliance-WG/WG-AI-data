# Summary

The CWE entry describes a hardware logic race condition weakness that can result in security protections being bypassed or compromised. It occurs when logic gates receive inputs that change at different times, causing glitches or timing errors that can be exploited. This can happen in access control logic or state machines handling sensitive operations. Examples are provided of vulnerable multiplexer and DMA module logic in Verilog code. The mitigations suggest using design practices to eliminate race conditions and implementing logic redundancy on critical paths.

# Summary bullet points

* Race conditions in hardware logic can cause glitches that result in incorrect outputs from gates
* This can allow attackers to bypass access controls or protections in security-sensitive components
* It often occurs when gates get inputs that traverse paths with different delays  
* Example shows vulnerable multiplexer Verilog code that could enable privilege escalation
* Another example demonstrates issue in DMA module's state machine logic
* Suggested mitigations include redundancy, strict state design, defaulting safely
