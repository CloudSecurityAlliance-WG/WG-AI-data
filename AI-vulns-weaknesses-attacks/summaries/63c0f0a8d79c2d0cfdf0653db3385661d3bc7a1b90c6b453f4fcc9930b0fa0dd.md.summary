# Summary

The CWE-369 weakness describes when a product divides a value by zero, typically occurring when an unexpected input value is provided or an error is not properly handled. This can lead to crashes, exits/restarts, denial of service, and other availability impacts. Recommendations include validating inputs used as denominators to prevent divide by zero, and implementing error handling to catch divide by zero errors to prevent crashes. Examples are provided in Java, C, and C# code.
