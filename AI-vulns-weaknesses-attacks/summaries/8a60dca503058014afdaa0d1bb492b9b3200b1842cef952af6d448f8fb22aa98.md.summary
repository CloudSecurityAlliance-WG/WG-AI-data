Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-525, a weakness related to web applications not using appropriate caching policies for pages and forms containing sensitive information. This can result in sensitive data being stored in the browser cache and exposed to unauthorized parties. The key points are:

- Web apps should use restrictive caching policies for sensitive data to prevent it lingering in the browser cache
- Public terminals are most at risk as subsequent users can view cached sensitive data
- Mitigations include protecting cached info, using encryption, and limiting unnecessary sensitive data in the cache
