# Summary

This document describes the weakness CWE-338 regarding the use of cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) in security contexts. It explains that using non-cryptographic PRNGs to generate random values for cryptography can expose the system to attacks. For example, if a weak PRNG generates values used in authentication, attackers could more easily guess session IDs or keys to bypass access controls. The document provides code examples in Java and C demonstrating the problem, references real-world vulnerabilities resulting from weak PRNGs, and recommends using cryptographically strong hardware-based RNGs as the solution. Potential mitigations are to use cryptographic functions like CryptGenRandom on Windows or hw_rand() on Linux.

# Summary bullet points

* Using non-cryptographic PRNGs in cryptography can enable attacks 
* Weak PRNGs used for authentication can allow guessing of session IDs/keys to bypass access controls
* Examples show predictable rand() and Random.nextInt() functions 
* Real vulnerabilities have allowed brute forcing and session hijacking
* Hardware-based cryptographic RNGs recommended as the solution
* Mitigations include CryptGenRandom and hw_rand()
