Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes insufficient logging (CWE-778), which refers to when a security-critical event occurs but the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event in the logs. Key points:

- Failing to properly log security events makes malicious behavior harder to detect and hinders forensic analysis after an attack. This is a non-repudiation issue that hides potentially malicious activities.

- As organizations adopt cloud storage, detailed logging may need to be manually enabled since it can incur additional costs. For example, Azure storage logging is disabled by default. 

- Examples are provided of insufficient logging in various contexts, like failing to log failed authentication attempts which could hide brute force attacks, or not logging all relevant operations in cloud storage services.

- Mitigations focus on ensuring centralized, multi-level logging that captures security successes and failures, and configuring log retention appropriately to enable attack detection without excessive cost. Specific steps are provided for enabling logging in Azure cloud storage.

# Summary bullet points

* When security events aren't logged properly, it hides malicious activities and makes problems harder to diagnose
* Adopting cloud storage often requires manually enabling detailed logging that is disabled by default to avoid costs
* Failing to log events like failed logins, restricted web access, or storage operations hides security issues  
* Can help attackers avoid detection when performing brute force authentication attacks
* Mitigations include detailed central logging of security events and appropriate log retention configuration
* Specific steps listed to enable logging in Azure cloud storage services
