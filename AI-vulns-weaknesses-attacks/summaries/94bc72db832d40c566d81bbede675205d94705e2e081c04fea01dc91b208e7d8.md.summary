# Summary

The data describes CWE-1273, a weakness related to device unlock credential sharing. Specifically, it refers to the sensitive credentials needed to unlock functionality on devices during manufacturing and testing. If these credentials are shared across multiple parties, it can increase the risk of exposure and compromise. The data explains how different companies are often involved in the design, manufacturing, and testing of hardware devices. All of these parties may need access to special debug and test modes that are normally locked down. However, sharing the unlock credentials across multiple organizations with varying security policies greatly raises the chance of leakage. If compromised, the credentials could be used by attackers to unlock devices and access protected functionality to steal data, modify the device, or execute malicious code.

# Summary bullet points
