Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-696 weakness describes a situation where multiple related behaviors or operations are performed in the wrong order, resulting in security vulnerabilities. Some examples provided include:

- Validating user input before canonicalizing the input, allowing bypass of validation checks through techniques like directory traversal. The proper order should be to canonicalize then validate.

- Reading sensitive files into memory before checking user access permissions. This unnecessarily loads files the user may not have access to. The check should happen first. 

- Enabling access to a protected asset before properly checking the access control permissions. This could allow unauthorized access before the checks occur.

The key points are that order of operations matters from a security perspective, and validating/authorizing access should happen before enabling access or exposing sensitive data. Performing authorization too late allows windows for attack or data exposure.

# Summary bullet points

* Weakness involves multiple related behaviors performed in the wrong order, enabling resultant vulnerabilities
* One example is validating user input before canonicalizing, allowing bypass through directory traversal 
* Another example is reading files before checking user access permissions, exposing data unnecessarily
* Also seen when access to protected assets is enabled before authorization checks occur
* Proper order should check permissions/validate access first, then enable access/exposure
* Authorization after asset access allows attack windows to violate controls
