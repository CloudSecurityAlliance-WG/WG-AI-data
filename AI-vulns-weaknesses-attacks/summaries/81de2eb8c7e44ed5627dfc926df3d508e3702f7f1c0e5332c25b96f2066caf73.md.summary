Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-799 describes the weakness of improper control of interaction frequency. This refers to a product failing to properly limit the number or frequency of interactions with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests from a human or automated process. This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected, leading to consequences like denial of service, bypassing of program logic, or compromise of sensitive information. Examples are provided such as an authentication system that allows unlimited guess attempts of a password (allowing brute force attacks) or a web site poll that expects a human to only vote once per day but does not enforce this limit.
