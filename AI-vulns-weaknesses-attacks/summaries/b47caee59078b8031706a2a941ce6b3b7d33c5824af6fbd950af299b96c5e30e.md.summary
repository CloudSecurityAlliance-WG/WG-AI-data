Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is the summarization and analysis:

# Summary

This CWE entry describes the weakness of sensitive non-volatile information not being protected during debug operations. Certain security-sensitive values like encryption keys, manufacturing data, etc. are stored in fuses and accessed at boot or runtime. These values are stored temporarily in registers/memories and access-protected. However, debug access to these temporary locations is not blocked, allowing unauthorized access to the sensitive data.  

# Summary bullet points

* Security-sensitive data like keys stored in fuses, accessed at boot/runtime and temporarily held in registers/memories
* Temporary storage locations access-controlled during normal operation
* Debug access to temporary locations not blocked, allowing unauthorized data access
