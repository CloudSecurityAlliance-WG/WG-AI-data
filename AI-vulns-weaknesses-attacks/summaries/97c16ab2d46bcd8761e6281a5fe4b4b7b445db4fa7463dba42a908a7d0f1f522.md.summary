Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content from the CWE website regarding CWE-309: Use of Password System for Primary Authentication:

# Summary

The content describes the weakness (CWE-309) of using password systems as the primary means of authentication. It explains that passwords alone are vulnerable to various attacks like guessing, brute forcing, rainbow table cracking etc. Thus using them as the only factor for authentication makes the system highly vulnerable. 

The key points are:
- Passwords should not be used alone for authentication and should be combined with other factors like tokens, biometrics etc. 
- Passwords should be stored encrypted and in non-reversible form to prevent theft.
- Password aging should be enforced to require periodic refreshing. 
- Password strength requirements should enforce use of upper, lower, numbers and symbols.
- Zero-knowledge password protocols like SRP can be used to avoid sending plain passwords.

Overall, the content emphasizes that relying solely on passwords for authentication often leads to compromise of user accounts and should be avoided.

# Summary bullet points

* Passwords alone are vulnerable to attacks like guessing, brute forcing, rainbow table cracking. 
* Using passwords as only authentication factor makes systems highly vulnerable.
* Passwords should be combined with other factors like tokens or biometrics for authentication.  
* Stored passwords should be encrypted and non-reversible.
* Enforce password aging to require periodic refresh.
* Enforce password complexity requirements.  
* Use zero-knowledge password protocols to avoid sending plain passwords. 
* Relying solely on passwords often leads to compromise of accounts.
