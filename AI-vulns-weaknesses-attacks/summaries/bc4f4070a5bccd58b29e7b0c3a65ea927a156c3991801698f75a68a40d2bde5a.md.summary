Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content you provided:

# Summary

The content describes CWE-475, a common weakness enumeration related to undefined behavior for input to APIs. It states that the behavior of a function is undefined unless its control parameter is set to a specific value. This can lead to quality degradation and varying impacts depending on the context. The weakness is applicable across languages and platforms. It can be introduced in architecture/design and implementation phases. Detection methods include automated static analysis tools that analyze source code to find potentially vulnerable patterns. 

The weakness is a child of CWE-573 (Improper Following of Specification by Caller) and a member of several CWE views and categories related to code quality issues. It is at the base level of abstraction which is preferred for mapping to root causes of vulnerabilities. The description notes that constraints on arguments for some internal Linux libc functions can lead to undefined behavior if not met. It also lists some example functions where value constraints should be followed.

# Summary bullet points

* Undefined behavior when control parameter for a function is not set to a specific required value
* Can lead to quality degradation and varying context-dependent impacts 
* Applicable across languages and platforms
* Introduced in architecture/design and implementation phases
* Detection via static analysis tools analyzing source code
* Child of CWE-573 (Improper Following of Specification by Caller) 
* Member of code quality CWE views and categories
* At base abstraction level preferred for mapping vulnerabilities
* Notes libc function argument constraints that can cause undefined behavior if violated
* Gives examples like __xmknod requiring value 1 for 3rd parameter
