Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1320, a weakness related to improper protection of outbound error messages and alert signals from hardware sensors. Sensors monitor conditions like temperature and compare to thresholds. Alert signals may trigger remedial actions like system shutdown. If alerts are not properly secured, they could be disabled or used to generate false alerts, causing instability, denial of service, etc.

Examples are given related to thermal sensors - malicious software could reprogram the GPIO pin used for the alert signal to mask real alerts or generate fake ones. 

Mitigations suggest alert signals should be protected from access by untrusted agents, with only trusted hardware/firmware able to alter configurations.
