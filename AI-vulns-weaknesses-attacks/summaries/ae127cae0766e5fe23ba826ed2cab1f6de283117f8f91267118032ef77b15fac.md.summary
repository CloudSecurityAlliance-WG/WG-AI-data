Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of missing XML validation when processing XML input from untrusted sources (CWE-112). Without validating XML against the proper schema, the system is vulnerable to unexpected, malicious, or unreasonable input that attackers could exploit. Proper input validation by validating against a known XML schema or DTD helps ensure well-formed, structured input. 

The key consequences are potential integrity issues and unexpected system state if malicious XML payload exploits the lack of validation. Static analysis security testing tools can automatically detect missing validation. Recommended mitigations include always validating XML input against known XML schemas or DTDs before processing to guarantee well-formedness.
