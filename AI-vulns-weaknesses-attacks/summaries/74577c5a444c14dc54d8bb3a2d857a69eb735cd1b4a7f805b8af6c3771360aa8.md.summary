Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of using an empty string as a password in configuration files. This is insecure as it allows unauthorized access. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long, avoid dictionary words, and never use an empty string. The entry provides examples of empty passwords in Java properties and ASP.NET config files. It explains the impact being gaining privileges/assuming identity at a high likelihood. Mitigations suggest proper password policies.
