Message:  # Summary

The text discusses membership inference attacks, where an attacker can determine if a data record was part of a model's training dataset or not. It provides an example where researchers predicted a patient's main medical procedure based on attributes like age, gender, and hospital. The key takeaway is that organizations are at risk if they do not protect against these kinds of attacks, especially on sensitive personal data. Even if unsure about protections, there may still be risk. With AI and ML systems expanding, it's crucial that data and privacy safeguards evolve as well against new forms of attacks enabled by advanced algorithms.

# Summary bullet points

* Membership inference attacks allow attackers to determine if a data record was in a model's training data.
* Example given where researchers predicted patients' medical procedures from other innocuous attributes.  
* Organizations that don't protect against these attacks are at risk.
* Unsure protections also indicate potential risk still exists.  
* As AI/ML advances, data and privacy safeguards must evolve against emerging attack methods.
