# Summary

The text appears to be from a website called PLOT4ai, which contains a library of threats related to AI and ML. The site classifies threats into 8 categories and provides some guidance on assessing if an AI system complies with data protection principles around purpose limitation and consent. Specifically, it poses questions around whether data collected for one purpose can be reused for another purpose without appropriate consent, stating that doing so may put practitioners at risk of violations. The site seems aimed at helping AI developers and users assess threats and risks relating to responsible and ethical AI practices.
