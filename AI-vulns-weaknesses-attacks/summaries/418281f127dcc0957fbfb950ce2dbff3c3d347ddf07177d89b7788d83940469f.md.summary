Message:  # Summary

The CWE-464 weakness describes the accidental addition of data structure sentinels which can cause serious programming logic issues. Data structure sentinels like null characters are used to mark structure boundaries but should be protected from modification. Adding or changing sentinels could truncate data structures or cause them to not work properly. Proper input validation and error checking is needed to prevent introducing sentinel values. Using abstraction libraries can also help reduce risk from dangerous APIs that could introduce sentinels.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-464 involves accidental modification of data structure sentinels like null characters
* Sentinels mark structure of data like end of strings or linked lists
* Modifying sentinels can truncate data structures or make them not work properly 
* Need input validation to prevent sentinel values from being introduced
* Error checking code should not return sentinel values on failure
* Use abstraction libraries to reduce risk from APIs that could add sentinels
