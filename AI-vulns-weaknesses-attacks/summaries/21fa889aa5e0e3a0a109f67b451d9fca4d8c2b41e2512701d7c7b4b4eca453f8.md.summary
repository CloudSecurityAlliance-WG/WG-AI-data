# Summary

The document describes an incorrect type conversion or cast weakness (CWE-704) in software. This occurs when a product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type. This can lead to security issues such as out-of-bounds reads/writes, heap corruption, lost/misinterpreted data, and more.

Key points related to information security:

- Incorrect type conversions can enable attackers to modify data or memory they should not have access to. For example, converting a string pointer to an integer could allow an attacker to manipulate the pointer to access arbitrary memory locations.

- Converting unsigned integers to signed integers without checking for negative values can lead to integer overflows. This can in turn result in heap corruption, out-of-bounds accesses, crashes, etc.

- Care must be taken when doing type conversions, especially between numeric types, pointers, strings, and other structures. Meticulous validation is required.

There are examples demonstrating how subtle type conversion bugs can inadvertently give attackers control over data and memory. Fuzz testing is called out as an effective technique for uncovering such issues. Various coding standards are referenced emphasizing the need for secure type conversions.

# Summary bullet points

* Incorrect type conversions can lead to issues like out-of-bounds reads/writes, heap corruption, lost/misinterpreted data
* Converting unsigned to signed integers without validation can enable integer overflows 
* Converting pointers to integers or vice versa in an unsafe way allows memory manipulation 
* Attackers can exploit small type conversion bugs to arbitrarily read/write memory and data
* Coding standards emphasize performing explicit validation around type conversions  
* Fuzz testing is highly effective at generating test cases that expose type conversion bugs
