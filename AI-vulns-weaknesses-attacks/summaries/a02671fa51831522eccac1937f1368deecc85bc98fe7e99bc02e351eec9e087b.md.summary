Message:  # Summary

The CWE-124 entry describes the weakness of buffer underwrite, also known as buffer underflow, where a program writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location before the start of the buffer. This typically happens when a pointer is decremented before the buffer, pointer arithmetic results in a negative position, or a negative index is used. The consequences include crashing, executing arbitrary code if the memory can be controlled, bypassing protections, and violating policies by modifying data incorrectly. Common languages affected are C and C++. Mitigations involve validating indices and pointers to ensure they are within expected ranges. 

# Summary bullet points

* Buffer underwrite/underflow is writing to a buffer with a pointer referencing before the start of the buffer
* Typically happens from decrementing a pointer too far, pointer math resulting in negative position, using negative index
* Consequences include crashes, arbitrary code execution, bypassing protections, data corruption
* Affects C and C++ commonly 
* Mitigations involve validating pointer indices stay within expected ranges
