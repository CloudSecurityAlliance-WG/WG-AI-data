# Summary

The content describes CWE-77, a common weakness related to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, also known as command injection. It explains that this happens when an application constructs a command using externally-influenced input that is not properly neutralized. Attackers can inject additional commands by adding separators like semi-colons. This can allow them to execute arbitrary unauthorized commands with the privileges of the vulnerable application. 

The content provides extended descriptions, relationships to other weaknesses, examples of vulnerable code, real-world vulnerabilities, potential mitigations like input validation and run time policy enforcement, and references. It notes that CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was the actual weakness.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-77 relates to improper neutralization of input leading to command injection vulnerabilities
* Happens when apps construct commands using input that is not properly neutralized 
* Attackers inject separators like semi-colons to add unauthorized commands
* Can allow execution of commands with privileges of vulnerable app
* Provides examples of vulnerabilities and example vulnerable code 
* Suggests mitigations like input validation and run time policy enforcement
* Commonly misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) should be used instead
