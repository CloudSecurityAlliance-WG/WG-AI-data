Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry describes an improper neutralization of web scripting syntax in HTTP headers vulnerability (CWE-644). This occurs when a product fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input added to HTTP response headers before sending them to the client. As a result, malicious input containing browser-executable code could end up in the headers, leading to cross-site scripting, HTTP response splitting or other attacks against clients. To mitigate this, output validation should be performed on data put in headers to filter/escape unsafe input. Script execution may also be disabled in clients. This impacts integrity and confidentiality at the technical level by allowing unauthorized code execution and data access. The vulnerability is seen as highly likely to be exploited.
