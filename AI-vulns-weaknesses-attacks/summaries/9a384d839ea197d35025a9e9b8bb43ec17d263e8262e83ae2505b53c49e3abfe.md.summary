Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness related to password aging policies that allow for excessively long password expiration periods. It explains that while password aging was previously thought to improve security, current guidance often recommends against frequent forced password changes. However, some organizations still employ long password expiration windows to meet compliance requirements. The entry advises limiting the maximum password age and notifying users ahead of pending expiration to mitigate issues. It also suggests preventing password reuse and disabling paste functionality in password fields, although the latter can reduce usability. Overall, the content focuses on the risks of lengthy password expiration policies and provides guidance on improving authentication systems.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-263 refers to password aging policies with expiration periods that are too long, allowing more opportunity for passwords to be compromised over time.
* While previously recommended, frequent forced password changes are no longer considered an effective security mechanism by many experts. 
* Some organizations still use long password expiration windows to meet compliance requirements like PCI DSS.  
* Suggested mitigations include limiting maximum password age and notifying users ahead of pending expiration.
* Additional defenses include preventing password reuse and disabling paste capabilities in password fields, although this can reduce usability.
* Long expiration periods give attackers more time to crack passwords, increasing account compromise risk.
