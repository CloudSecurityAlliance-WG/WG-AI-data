Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is a summary of the key information about CWE-828: Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe from the CWE website:

# Summary

CWE-828 discusses signal handlers in software that are not asynchronous-safe, meaning the functionality called from the signal handler is not reentrant or could be interrupted. This can lead to corruption of global state or race conditions. Common problems include:

- Calling non-reentrant functions like malloc() from signal handlers
- Modifying global variables from signal handlers that are also used in main program logic
- Having the same signal handler registered for multiple signals, allowing it to interrupt itself
- Having a signal arrive while a non-reentrant function is executing, corrupting its state

Consequences include denial of service, crashes, or even potential code execution if security mechanisms are compromised. 

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-828 covers signal handlers containing non asynchronous-safe functionality 
* Can lead to corruption of global state or race conditions between handler and main logic
* Calls non-reentrant functions like malloc()
* Modifies global variables used elsewhere
* Same handler used for multiple signals that could interrupt each other  
* Signal arrives while non-reentrant function executing, corrupting its state
* Causes crashes, denial of service, or potential code execution if exploits protections
