# Summary

The text describes CWE-600, an uncaught exception vulnerability in servlets. Servlets are Java programs that run inside a web server to dynamically generate content. The vulnerability occurs when a servlet does not catch all possible exceptions, allowing sensitive error messages to be returned to the user. This reveals debugging info like stack traces, SQL queries, database type and version, etc. Attackers can use this info to target known flaws. The text recommends catching all exception types to prevent exposure of sensitive data.
