Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an information security weakness related to the processing of uploaded files in PHP applications. Specifically, it refers to the use of four deprecated global variables ($varname, $varname_size, $varname_name, $varname_type) to handle uploaded files. These variables can be easily overwritten by attackers, allowing them to manipulate the application into processing arbitrary unauthorized files. This could lead to sensitive file disclosure or modification.

The entry recommends upgrading to newer PHP versions and using built-in functions like is_uploaded_file() and move_uploaded_file() to properly verify uploaded files. Additional mitigations include writing a custom verification function if stuck with older PHP versions.
