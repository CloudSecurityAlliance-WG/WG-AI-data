Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-8, a common weakness in software systems related to J2EE misconfiguration where entity beans are incorrectly declared as remote. This exposes methods that can read or write sensitive data, violating confidentiality and integrity. The document provides details on the weakness, its relationships to other weaknesses, potential mitigations, mappings to other taxonomies, and references.

Key points related to information and AI security:

- Exposing entity beans as remote can enable attackers to read sensitive data or modify data unexpectedly, impacting confidentiality and integrity
- Proper configuration of access controls on entity beans is important to limit attack surface 
- When remote access is needed, validate data carefully to prevent unauthorized changes

# Summary bullet points

* Document describes CWE-8 J2EE misconfiguration weakness where entity beans declared remote
* Exposes methods that can read/write sensitive data violating confidentiality and integrity
* Related to improper access controls and attack surface exposure
* Potential mitigation is to declare beans local when possible 
* When remote access needed, ensure sensitive data not exposed
* Validate data to prevent unauthorized changes
