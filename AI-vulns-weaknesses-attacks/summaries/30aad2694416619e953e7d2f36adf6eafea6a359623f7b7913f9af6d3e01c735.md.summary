Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-222 weakness describes the truncation of security-relevant information in a way that obscures the source or nature of an attack. This can make it difficult to determine the origin of attacks and allow them to continue undetected. The truncated information could include logs, alerts, error messages or other data that provides insight into malicious activity. The weakness enables attacks like phishing and bypassing filters by hiding incriminating details. It falls under broader categories of information loss and audit/logging errors. Real-world vulnerabilities have allowed long URLs to bypass filters or excluded parts of requests from logs. The weakness highlights the need to properly handle security data to enable detection and response.
