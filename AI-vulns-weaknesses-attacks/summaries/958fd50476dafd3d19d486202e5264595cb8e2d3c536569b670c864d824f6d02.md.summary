# Summary

This content is from the PLOT4ai website, which contains a library of AI/ML threats classified into 8 categories. The excerpt focuses on one specific threat regarding data minimization and model accuracy. It points out that limiting data used to train AI models could negatively impact their accuracy. However, data minimization is considered a best practice. Thus, there is a tension between using enough data to maximize accuracy versus limiting data to protect privacy. The passage asks if it is possible to adhere to data minimization principles while also ensuring robust model performance. It states that answering "no" puts one at risk of issues from low model accuracy. Even being uncertain represents some risk.
