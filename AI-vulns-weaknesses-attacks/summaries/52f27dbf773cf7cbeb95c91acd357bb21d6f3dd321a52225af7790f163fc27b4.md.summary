Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the text:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-1111, a weakness in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) system. CWE-1111 stands for "Incomplete I/O Documentation" and refers to cases where a product's documentation does not adequately define inputs, outputs, or system/software interfaces. This is considered an indirect weakness that makes it easier to introduce security issues or makes them harder to detect. The weakness is prohibited from being used to map to real-world vulnerabilities as it is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications. 

The text provides background on CWE and classifications for CWE-1111. It is labeled as a child of "Insufficient Technical Documentation" (CWE-1059) and a member of "Documentation Issues" (CWE-1225). It is also considered relevant to the research concepts and software development views in CWE. The text states it should not be used for vulnerability mapping and analysts should look for weaknesses with more direct security implications instead.
