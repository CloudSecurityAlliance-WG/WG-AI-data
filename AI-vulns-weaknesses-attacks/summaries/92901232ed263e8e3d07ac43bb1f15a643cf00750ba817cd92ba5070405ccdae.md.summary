Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-471 weakness describes when a product fails to properly protect assumed-immutable data from modification by an attacker. This occurs when certain inputs critical to application functioning are modifiable when they should not be, such as hidden web form fields, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups. Consequences include compromised integrity through unauthorized data modification and unexpected application state. Mitigations focus on implementing integrity checks on untrusted data sources and storing critical data in trusted locations safe from external influence.
