Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-215 describes the weakness of inserting sensitive information into debugging code. If debugging code containing sensitive data is not properly disabled in production environments, it could expose confidential information to attackers. This applies to any product that includes debugging statements with sensitive data that remain enabled after release. 

The entry explains that debugging often requires reporting detailed technical information to developers. However, failure to disable debugging code properly enables attackers to access private data. It relates to improper information management and control over debug code activation. The consequences include compromised confidentiality through unauthorized data access.  

Specific examples are provided of debug statements in code that print sensitive data if a debug flag is set. Additional real-world cases are cited involving debug options in an FTP client, CGI script, and other contexts exposing passwords and other private user details.

Recommended mitigations are to completely remove debug statements with sensitive information from production code, and to compartmentalize systems to limit trust boundaries. Detection methods via static application security testing are also outlined.

# Summary bullet points

* Inserting sensitive data in debugging code enables exposure if debug features remain active in production
* Failure to disable debug code properly results in confidentiality breaches through data access
* Consequences relate to improper information management and control over debug activation  
* Real cases listed of debug options exposing passwords and private user details 
* Mitigations include removing debug statements entirely, compartmentalizing systems, and static testing
