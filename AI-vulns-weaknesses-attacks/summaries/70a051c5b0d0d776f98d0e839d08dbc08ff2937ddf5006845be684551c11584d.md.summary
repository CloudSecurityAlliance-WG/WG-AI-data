Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-161 describes an weakness related to improper neutralization of multiple leading special characters in input. This can allow attackers to bypass access restrictions or cause the system to take unexpected actions. The key points are:

- Input containing multiple leading special elements like "/" or "\" is not properly neutralized or validated by the system receiving the input. This can allow the input to be interpreted in unexpected ways.

- This can lead to attackers being able to bypass access restrictions to access files or functionality they should not have access to. 

- It can also cause the downstream system receiving the input to go into an unexpected state or take unintended actions.

- Proper input validation, encoding, and filtering needs to be implemented to prevent multiple leading special elements from reaching downstream components in an unsafe manner. Allowlists should be used to only allow known good input. Denylists can also help block known bad input signatures.

# Summary bullet points

* Input with multiple leading special elements like / or \ not properly neutralized 
* Can allow attackers to bypass access restrictions to files or functions
* Can cause unexpected behavior or system state in downstream components receiving input
* Need proper input validation, encoding, filtering to prevent multiple leading special elements from reaching downstream unchecked
* Use allowlists to restrict input to known good input and denylists to block known bad input
