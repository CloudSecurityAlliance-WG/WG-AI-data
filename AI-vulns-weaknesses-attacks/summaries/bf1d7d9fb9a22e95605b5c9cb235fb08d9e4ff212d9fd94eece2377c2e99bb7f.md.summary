# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-450 describes a weakness where a user interface has multiple interpretations of user input but does not prompt or warn the user when it selects a less secure interpretation. This can lead to unintended actions or access being performed, potentially enabling attacks or unauthorized activity. The mitigations recommend input validation best practices, including assuming all inputs are malicious, only accepting known good inputs, rejecting inputs that don't strictly conform to specifications, and considering all relevant properties when validating. Decoding and canonicalizing inputs before validation is also recommended to avoid bypassing filters. This is an important consideration for information security to prevent attackers from exploiting ambiguities in user interfaces. Careful design of user interfaces and input handling is needed.

# Summary bullet points

* User interface has multiple interpretations of input but doesn't prompt user when selecting less secure option
* Can lead to unintended actions, access, attacks if insecure input interpretation is selected
* Recommends input validation best practices - whitelisting, strict conformance checking, decoding/canonicalizing before validation
* Important for information security to avoid UI ambiguity exploits
* Need careful user interface and input validation design
