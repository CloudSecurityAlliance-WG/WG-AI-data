# Summary

The content describes CWE-940, a weakness related to improper verification of the source of a communication channel. Specifically, it refers to cases where a product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request, but does not properly verify that the request comes from an expected/authorized origin. As a result, an attacker could gain access to unexpected functionality or privileges by spoofing the origin of requests. 

The content provides examples of this weakness in Android and iOS applications that use custom URL schemes to communicate between a web view and native code. Since the applications do not check the origin of intents or URL requests, a malicious website loaded in the web view could trigger functionality meant only for trusted applications.

Potential mitigations include using mechanisms to validate the identity of the source, like certificates, and checking/allowlisting applications that can interface with sensitive functionality exposed through custom URL schemes.

# Summary bullet points

* Shown in apps with web views and custom URL schemes to call native code
* Android app example shows malicious site triggering user account deletion 
* iOS app example shows site accessing sensitive data/functions meant for trusted apps
* Mitigations include validating source identity and allowlisting applications
