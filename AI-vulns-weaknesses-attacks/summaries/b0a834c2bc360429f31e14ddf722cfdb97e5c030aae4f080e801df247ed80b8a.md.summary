Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an SQL injection vulnerability that can occur when using Hibernate to build dynamic SQL queries with user-controlled input. This allows an attacker to modify the query's meaning or execute arbitrary SQL commands. It is categorized as a child of broader SQL injection weaknesses. The impact is read and modification of application data at the technical level, compromising confidentiality and integrity. Mitigations highlighted include using a non-SQL database, following principle of least privilege for database accounts, duplicating server-side any security checks made client-side, using prepared statements with bound variables, allowlisting user input, and narrowly defining the set of safe characters expected for input parameters. The vulnerability is applicable for mapping to real-world weaknesses.
