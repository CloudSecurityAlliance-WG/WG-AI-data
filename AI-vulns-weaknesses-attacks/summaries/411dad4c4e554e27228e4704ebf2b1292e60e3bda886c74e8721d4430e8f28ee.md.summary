Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1056, a weakness related to invokable control elements with variadic parameters. It states that methods or functions with signatures supporting a variable number of arguments can reduce reliability and make analysis difficult. While not a direct security issue, this complexity could indirectly introduce vulnerabilities or make them harder to detect.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1056 relates to invokable control elements like methods or functions with variadic parameters, supporting a variable number of arguments
* This can reduce reliability and make analysis inefficient or uncertain
* Not a direct security weakness but could indirectly enable vulnerabilities by increasing complexity
* Regarded as a quality issue that can lead to security-relevant weaknesses being introduced or missed
* Mapped as "prohibited" for vulnerability mapping purposes as it is not a direct security weakness
