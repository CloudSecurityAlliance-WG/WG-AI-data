Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of missing documentation for the design of a product. This lack of documentation makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, as well as detect and fix potential vulnerabilities. 

The weakness is considered an indirect quality issue that could make it easier to introduce security weaknesses or make them harder to detect. It is classified under documentation issues, cross-cutting problems related to hardware design, and gaps in details/data for ICS engineering.

While a problematic practice, the entry notes this weakness has no direct security implications which is why mapping it to real-world vulnerabilities is prohibited. The rationale advises looking for weaknesses more directly related to insecure behaviors with security implications instead.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes weakness of missing documentation for product design
* Lack of documentation makes product harder to understand, maintain, and secure
* Indirect quality issue that could enable security weaknesses
* Classified under documentation issues, hardware design, ICS engineering gaps  
* Not directly a security risk itself which is why mapping to vulnerabilities prohibited
* Advises focusing on weaknesses linked to direct insecure behaviors instead
