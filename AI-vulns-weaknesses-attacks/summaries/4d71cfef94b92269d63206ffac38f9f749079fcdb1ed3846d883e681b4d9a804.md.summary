Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes the weakness of accepting path input with a trailing dot (e.g. 'filedir.') without proper validation. This can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow attackers to traverse the filesystem to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. It is a variant of improper path resolution and trailing special element neutralization weaknesses. Known consequences include bypassing access controls and exposing source code. Examples of vulnerabilities exploiting this weakness resulting in source code disclosure and bypassing directory access restrictions are provided.
