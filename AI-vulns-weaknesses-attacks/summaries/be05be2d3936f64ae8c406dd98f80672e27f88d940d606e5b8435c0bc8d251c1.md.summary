Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The weakness described is excessive execution of sequential searches of data resources. This occurs when a data query against a database table or view is configured in a way that does not use an index, causing sequential searches to be performed. 

This can reduce performance of the product. If reachable by an attacker, the performance degradation could introduce a vulnerability. It is considered an indirect weakness that could make it easier to introduce security weaknesses or make them harder to detect.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes a weakness where data queries against databases are configured without using indexes, causing sequential searches
