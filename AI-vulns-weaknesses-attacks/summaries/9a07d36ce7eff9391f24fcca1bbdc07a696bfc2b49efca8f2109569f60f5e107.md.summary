Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-703 weakness describes a product's failure to properly anticipate or handle exceptional or unusual conditions that rarely occur during normal operation. This can lead to vulnerabilities where attackers can trigger these exceptional conditions to cause denial-of-service crashes, data corruption, information disclosure, or other impacts. 

Specific examples are provided, such as improperly handling I/O errors or end-of-file conditions in C programs using fgets(), which can lead to buffer overflows. Another example shows overly broad Java exception handling using a generic Exception catch-block rather than specific exceptions, which reduces visibility into issues.

The key takeaways are that exceptional conditions should be properly handled through checks and responding appropriately. Otherwise attackers may be able to trigger crashes, corrupt data, or bypass security controls by inducing these exceptional states. Care should also be taken not to inadvertently introduce new weaknesses through overly generic exception handling.

# Summary bullet points

* Failures to properly anticipate or handle rare/exceptional conditions can enable attackers to trigger crashes, data corruption, info disclosure, etc.
* Examples include mishandling I/O errors or EOF in C code leading to overflows, or overly broad Java exception handling hiding issues 
* Exceptional conditions should have proper checks and handling to avoid inducing vulnerabilities
* Generic exception handling can also mask problems and make fixing issues harder
