# Summary

The CWE definition describes the weakness of calling the free() function on a pointer to memory that was not allocated dynamically using functions like malloc(), calloc(), or realloc(). This can corrupt the program's memory management data structures and cause crashes or vulnerabilities. The consequences range from data corruption to arbitrary code execution. Examples are given of code that incorrectly tries to free a stack allocated array or global array, when free() should only be used on pointers returned by the heap allocation functions. Recommended mitigations include only freeing pointers allocated dynamically, using libraries that protect against invalid pointers, using languages with built-in memory management, and address sanitizers.

# Summary bullet points

* Calling free() on a pointer to non-dynamically allocated memory can corrupt memory management structures
* Can cause crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution
* Examples show free() incorrectly called on stack or global arrays 
* Should only free() pointers returned by malloc(), calloc(), etc
* Mitigations:
    * Only free dynamically allocated pointers
    * Use libraries/languages with memory management
    * Address sanitizers
* Can allow attackers to write arbitrary data to memory
