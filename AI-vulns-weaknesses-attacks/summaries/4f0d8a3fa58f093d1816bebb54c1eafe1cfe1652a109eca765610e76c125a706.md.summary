# Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types. This refers to issues that can occur when converting data from one numeric data type to another, such as from long to integer. If invalid or unexpected values result from the conversion, it can introduce bugs or vulnerabilities if those values are used in sensitive contexts. Key points:

- Data can be omitted or translated incorrectly when converting between numeric types. This can result in unexpected values.
- If these unexpected values are used in sensitive contexts this can lead to degraded quality or integrity issues. 
- Consequences relate to technical impacts around unexpected application state and degraded quality.
- There is high likelihood of exploit if vulnerabilities result.
- Examples demonstrate integer truncation, precision loss, sign extension issues leading to unexpected values.
- Mitigations focus on avoiding unnecessary conversions and always checking allowed ranges.

# Summary bullet points

* Converting between numeric types can cause data loss, precision loss, or unexpected values
