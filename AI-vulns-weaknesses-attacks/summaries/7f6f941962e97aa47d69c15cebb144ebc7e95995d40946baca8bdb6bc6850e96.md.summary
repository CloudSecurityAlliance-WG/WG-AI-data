# Summary

The document describes CWE-767: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method. This refers to when a product defines a public method that reads or modifies a private variable. If an attacker can modify the private variable to unexpected values, it could violate assumptions elsewhere in the code. Also, if the attacker can read the private variable, it may expose sensitive information or enable further attacks. This is a child of CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere and a member of CWE-275 Permission Issues. It impacts integrity and exposes application data to modification by attackers. Examples demonstrate how declaring a private variable but allowing public methods to access it can enable privilege escalation or data exposure. Mitigations focus on proper validation and access controls around public methods that interface with private member data.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-767 refers to public methods accessing/modifying critical private variables
* Can violate assumptions and integrity of code
* May also expose sensitive data
* Child of CWE-668, member of CWE-275 
* Impacts integrity through data modification
* Examples show privilege escalation via public method typo
* Mitigations require validation/access control for public methods
