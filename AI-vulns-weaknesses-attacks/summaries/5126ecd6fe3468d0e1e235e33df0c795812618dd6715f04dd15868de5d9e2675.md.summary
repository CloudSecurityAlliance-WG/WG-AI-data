# Summary

The document describes CWE-912, a common weakness enumeration related to hidden functionality in software products. It states that hidden functionality that is not documented or accessible can increase attack surface and expose additional weaknesses. Examples are malicious code, developer shortcuts, and undisclosed features like telnet servers. Even non-malicious hidden functionality can alter execution logic and impact integrity. The document details relationships to other CWEs, applicable platforms, common consequences, observed examples, and potential mitigations like code coverage analysis.
