Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes an authentication bypass weakness that occurs when the authentication algorithm is sound, but the implementation allows it to be bypassed due to a separate primary weakness. This enables attackers to bypass access controls that rely on the compromised authentication. The weakness typically allows easy guessing or bypassing of passwords.

# Summary bullet points

* The authentication algorithm is secure, but the implementation allows bypass due to another weakness 
* Enables attackers to bypass access controls relying on that authentication
* Often allows easy password guessing or bypass
* Resultant weakness, not primary - most authentication bypasses are resultant of other weaknesses
* Can allow elevated privileges through bypassing admin authentication
