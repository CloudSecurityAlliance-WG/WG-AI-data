Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of incomplete model of endpoint features, where a product acts as an intermediary between two endpoints but does not have a complete understanding of an endpoint's features, behaviors or state. This can cause the product to perform incorrect actions based on its incomplete model. Examples are given of HTTP request smuggling attacks against proxies, and anti-virus products on mail servers that do not know how a client will handle certain attachments, potentially treating them as safe when the client may execute them.
