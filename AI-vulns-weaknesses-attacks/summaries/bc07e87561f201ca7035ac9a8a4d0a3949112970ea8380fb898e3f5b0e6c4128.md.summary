Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content on improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames:

# Summary

The article describes the weakness CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames. This weakness occurs when a web application does not properly restrict frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain. This can lead to user confusion about which interface they are interacting with. Attackers can exploit this to trick users into taking actions masked or hidden from their view. The impact varies but could allow gaining privileges, bypassing protections, or accessing/modifying data. 

Some key mitigations mentioned:
- Use the X-Frame-Options header to restrict which domains can frame the content 
- Use "frame-breaker" scripts to prevent framing by legacy browsers
- Use Content Security Policy frame-ancestors or frame-src directives to restrict framing

Automated static analysis tools can potentially detect instances of this weakness by modeling data flows in the code.
