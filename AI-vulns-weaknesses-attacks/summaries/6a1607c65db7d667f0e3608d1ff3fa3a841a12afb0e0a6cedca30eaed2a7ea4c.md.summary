Message:  Here is a summary of the key information about CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation:

# Summary

CWE-440 refers to a feature, API, or function not performing according to its specification. This means some aspect of the software is not behaving as expected or documented, leading to incorrect use or quality degradation.

The weakness typically arises during architecture/design or implementation phases. It can manifest in various technologies and platforms, including ICS/OT systems.

Consequences may include quality degradation and impacts that vary by context. An example is interrupt handling code in a RISC-V system that improperly allows user input to manipulate supervisor interrupt settings. This could enable denial-of-service attacks or privilege escalation.

Fixing these issues involves ensuring proper encapsulation and validation of inputs and outputs to prevent unintended behavior changes. Careful design reviews and testing focused on specified behavior are important.
