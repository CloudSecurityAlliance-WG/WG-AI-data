Message:  # Summary

The document summarizes information from the PLOT4ai library, which contains 86 threats related to AI/ML, classified into 8 categories. It focuses on ethical considerations when developing AI systems, specifically around ensuring positive user reactions, meeting user expectations for system functionality and data privacy, and the ability to roll back systems if users are dissatisfied. 

The key ideas are that AI developers should carefully evaluate whether their systems will elicit positive reactions and meet user expectations. If not, they risk backlash and reputational damage. Developers should also consider whether personal data processing is expected and appropriate. Finally, rollback mechanisms should be built into systems in case issues emerge after deployment. Considering these issues thoughtfully and proactively can help mitigate AI risks.
