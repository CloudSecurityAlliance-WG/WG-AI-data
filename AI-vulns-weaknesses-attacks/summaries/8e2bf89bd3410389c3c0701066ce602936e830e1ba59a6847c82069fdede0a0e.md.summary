Message:  # Summary

The CWE-842 weakness describes when a product or administrator incorrectly places a user into a group with more access or privileges than intended. This can allow the user to bypass security policies and access unexpected resources or perform unexpected actions that would normally be restricted. The access control system may not detect the unintended elevated permissions. This is a child of CWE-286 Incorrect User Management and a member of the CWE-1212 Authorization Errors view. It can allow attackers to gain privileges or assume identities in order to access protected resources. Examples are provided where operating systems, web servers, CMS platforms, and daemons incorrectly assign users to privileged groups like administrator or root, enabling privilege escalation.
