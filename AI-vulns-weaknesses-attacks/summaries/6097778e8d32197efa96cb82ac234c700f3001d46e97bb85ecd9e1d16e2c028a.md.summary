# Summary

The weakness described is related to incorrectly calling the free() function on a pointer that is not at the start of the allocated memory buffer. This can happen when memory is allocated on the heap, a pointer to the memory is manipulated through pointer arithmetic to point to somewhere within the buffer instead of the start, and then free() is called on that interior pointer. The result is corrupted memory, crashes, or potential code execution. Examples demonstrate how this weakness can occur through common C programming situations like searching a string buffer or tokenizing input. Mitigations include using a separate index variable instead of pointer arithmetic, using C++ smart pointers, or languages with built-in memory management.

# Summary bullet points

* Calling free() on pointer not at start of allocated memory buffer leads to memory corruption or code execution
* Occurs through common practices like pointer arithmetic traversal of heap buffers 
* Can use separate index instead of directly manipulating pointer
* Use C++ smart pointers or languages with memory management instead of manual memory allocation in C
* Libraries like glibc provide protections against invalid pointer frees
