Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of using duplicate keys in associative lists (alists). This can lead to ambiguity and unintended behavior when searching or sorting these lists. Specifically, duplicate keys may overwrite previous entries or cause sorting to not work as expected. It is recommended to use unique keys in alists or use hash tables instead. This issue impacts software quality and relies on incorrect developer assumptions about uniqueness of keys.
