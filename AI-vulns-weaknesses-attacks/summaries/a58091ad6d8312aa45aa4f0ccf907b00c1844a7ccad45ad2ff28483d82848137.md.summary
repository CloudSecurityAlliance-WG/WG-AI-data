Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-1072 describes a weakness where a product accesses a data resource through a database without using connection pooling capabilities. This can reduce performance as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead of opening and closing connections each time. While primarily a quality issue rather than direct security risk, poor performance could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if reachable by an attacker. 

# Summary bullet points

* Lack of connection pooling means overhead and time needed to open/close connections each time 
* Performance issues could enable vulnerabilities if reachable by attackers
* Primarily a quality issue rather than direct security risk
* Connection pools allow connection reuse without overhead
