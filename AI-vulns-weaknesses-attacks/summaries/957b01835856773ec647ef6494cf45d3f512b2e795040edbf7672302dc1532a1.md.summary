Message:  # Summary

This document from MITRE ATLAS discusses the technique of external harms, where adversaries abuse their access to a victim system and use its resources to cause additional harms beyond just compromising the system itself. These external harms can be financial, reputational, harm users, harm society, or steal machine learning intellectual property. The document summarizes the technique and provides a case study of how arbitrary code execution in Google Colab could enable these harms. It emphasizes the risks of adversaries leveraging compromised systems for broader attacks.
