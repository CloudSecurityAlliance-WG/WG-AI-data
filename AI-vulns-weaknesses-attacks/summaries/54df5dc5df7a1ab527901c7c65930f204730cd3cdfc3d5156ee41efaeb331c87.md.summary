# Summary

The content describes CWE-732, a weakness related to incorrectly assigning permissions for critical resources in software. It allows unintended actors to access sensitive information or modify critical resources. Common consequences include attackers reading sensitive data like credentials or configuration info, gaining privileges by replacing executables with malware, and destroying critical data. It often occurs because developers make assumptions about the software's operating environment and don't properly restrict permissions. Mitigations focus on setting the strictest permissions possible, sandboxing the software, dividing it into privilege zones, and environment hardening. The key info relates to ensuring permissions are configured correctly for resources that affect security and could enable attacks if accessible by unauthorized parties. 

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-732 involves incorrectly assigning permissions for critical software resources like files, allowing unintended access
* Can enable attackers to read sensitive data, gain privileges, or destroy critical data
* Often occurs because developers assume restrictive permissions rather than explicitly setting them
* Mitigations include strict permissions, sandboxing, privilege zones, environment hardening 
* Key is ensuring no unauthorized access for resources affecting security, integrity, confidentiality
