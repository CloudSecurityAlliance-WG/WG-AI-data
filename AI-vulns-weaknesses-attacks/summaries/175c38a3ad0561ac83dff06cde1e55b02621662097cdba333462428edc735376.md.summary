# Summary

The article describes CWE-88, an weakness related to improper neutralization of argument delimiters in commands, also known as argument injection. When creating command strings, developers may assume only intended arguments are processed. However, if untrusted input contains argument-separating delimiters, the command can end up with unintended arguments that modify behavior. This could allow attackers to execute unintended commands or code, read/modify data, or cause other unintended actions. 

Some mitigations discussed include avoiding building single command strings, using input validation, parameterization, encoding, and static/dynamic analysis tools. An example vulnerability is provided where a filename validation routine still allows "-" characters, enabling injection of arguments for the ls command.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-88 involves improper neutralization of delimiters when building command strings, enabling unintended arguments 
* Attackers can modify program behavior by injecting unexpected command arguments
* Consequences include code execution, data access/modification, or other unintended actions
* Mitigations involve input validation, avoiding command string concatenation, parameterization, encoding, and testing
* Example shows vulnerability in filename validation allowing "-" characters to inject arguments
