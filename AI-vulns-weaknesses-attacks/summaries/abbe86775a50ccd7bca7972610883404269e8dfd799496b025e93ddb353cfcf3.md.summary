Message:  Here is a summary of the key information from the text, focusing on information security and AI security-related content:

# Summary

The text describes improper input validation (CWE-20), which occurs when software does not properly validate input data to ensure it is safe for processing. This can allow attackers to craft malicious input that alters control flow or causes crashes, resource consumption, or arbitrary code execution. Key points:

- Input validation checks raw data like strings and numbers to ensure properties like size, type, syntactic correctness, etc. are as expected. This prevents unintended processing.
- Validation can apply to simple or structured/nested data. 
- Failure to validate can enable SQL injection, path traversal, buffer overflows, integer overflows, and other attacks.
- Input validation differs from output escaping, which transforms dangerous input into something safe rather than blocking it.
- The text describes various consequences like denial of service, data modification, and confidentiality breaches.
- Languages are not specifically vulnerable. Insecure programming leads to improper input validation.

# Summary bullet points

* Software flaw where input data is not properly validated to ensure safe processing
* Enables malicious input that alters control flow, crashes program, consumes resources, executes code
* Checks raw input strings, numbers, parameters for expected properties like size, type, syntax
* Applies to simple and structured/nested data 
* Leads to SQL injection, path traversal, buffer overflow, integer overflow, etc. 
* Differs from output escaping that transforms input into something safe
* Can cause denial of service, data modification, confidentiality breaches
* Insecure programming practices enable, not specific languages
