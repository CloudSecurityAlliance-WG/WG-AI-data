# Summary

The paper proposes a simple yet highly effective black-box adversarial attack method called Simple Black-box Attack (SimBA). The key idea is to iteratively pick a random direction from a predefined orthogonal basis, use the model's confidence scores to determine if that direction points towards or away from the decision boundary, and perturb the image by adding/subtracting a small step along that direction. This gradually moves the image across the decision boundary to cause misclassification. The attack requires only 20 lines of PyTorch code due to its simplicity. 

Empirical results demonstrate unprecedented query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art black-box attacks on ImageNet. For instance, SimBA achieves 98.6% attack success rate using only 1,665 queries on average while other methods require tens or hundreds of thousands of queries. Attacks on Google Cloud Vision also succeed with 70% probability using fewer than 5,000 queries. The proposed method establishes a new strong baseline for black-box adversarial attacks.
