Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of relying on a single source of data for critical information, which makes systems vulnerable to compromise if that one source is compromised. It advocates using multiple independent sources of data and cross-checking between them to detect potential issues (a "Practical Byzantine Fault" approach). The key points are:

- Relying on a single source of data leaves systems open to compromise if that source is compromised
- Adversaries could exploit this to inject false data by compromising the single data source 
- Systems should use multiple independent sources of data and cross-check between them
- Responses that are in the minority could indicate a compromised data source
- As impact severity increases, more independent data sources should be used

# Summary bullet points

* Relying on single data source leaves systems vulnerable if that source is compromised
* Adversaries could exploit this to inject false data 
* Systems should use multiple independent data sources
* Should cross-check between data sources to detect issues
* Minority responses may indicate compromised source
* More data sources needed for higher impact severity
