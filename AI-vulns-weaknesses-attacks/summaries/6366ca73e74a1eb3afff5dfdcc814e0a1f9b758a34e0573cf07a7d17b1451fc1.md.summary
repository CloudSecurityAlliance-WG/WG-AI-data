Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-826 weakness describes the premature release of a resource that is still intended to be used by the software or another actor. This occurs when the software releases a resource it should still be using, making it possible for operations to still occur on the released resource after it has potentially been repurposed. Consequences include denial of service, information exposure, or code execution if the released resource is reused or reallocated. A NULL dereference or crash could occur if subsequent operations attempt to access the released resource. This is different than properly releasing a resource but failing to clear references to it that are later used.

# Summary bullet points

* Premature release of a resource that should still be used by the software or another actor
* Can occur if software releases a resource too early while still performing operations on it  
* Consequences include denial of service, information exposure, code execution if released resource is repurposed and reused
* Could enable NULL dereference or crash if later operations access the released resource
* Differs from properly releasing a resource but failing to clear dangling references
