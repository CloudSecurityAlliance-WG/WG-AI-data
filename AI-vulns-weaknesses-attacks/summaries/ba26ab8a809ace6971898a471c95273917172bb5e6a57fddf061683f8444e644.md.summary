# Summary

The document describes CWE-1126, a weakness related to declaring variables with an unnecessarily wide scope in software code. Specifically, it involves declaring a variable in a broad scope like a class, but only using it within a method or loop. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain over time, indirectly harming security. It also might enable vulnerabilities by making the code more complex. The consequences relate to reduced maintainability of the system rather than direct security issues. Ultimately, this weakness reflects suboptimal coding practices that could impede detecting or fixing vulnerabilities down the line.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1126 involves declaring variable scopes wider than necessary, reducing code maintainability 
* Variables declared broadly in class scope, but only used locally in narrow scope like method
* Harms security indirectly by making code harder to understand, change, and audit
* Also enables vulnerabilities by increasing complexity 
* Reflects suboptimal coding practices, not direct weakness
* Consequences are lower maintainability versus immediate security impact
