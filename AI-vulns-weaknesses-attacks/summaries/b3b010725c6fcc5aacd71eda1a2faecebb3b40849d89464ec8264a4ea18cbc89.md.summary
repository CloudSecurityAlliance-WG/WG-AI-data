Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of obscuring security-relevant information by recording it under an alternate name rather than the canonical name of the affected entity. This can allow attackers to hide malicious activities by providing an alternate filename that obscures the real target. It is a child of the "Information Loss or Omission" weakness and can lead to impacts like gaining privileges or assuming identities by hiding activities.
