# Summary  

The paper proposes a new white-box adversarial attack algorithm called Auto Conjugate Gradient (ACG) attack, which is inspired by the conjugate gradient (CG) optimization method. The key idea is to use more diverse update directions compared to just using the steepest gradient descent, which can get stuck in local optima for nonconvex problems. Extensive experiments on 64 robust models show ACG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Auto PGD attack in terms of attack success rate, with fewer restarts and iterations. For example, ACG with just 1 restart (100 iterations) performs better than Auto PGD with 5 restarts (500 iterations) on over 75% of models. The reasons for ACG's better performance are analyzed. First, the ACG updates allow the search points to move much farther than Auto PGD. Second, ACG frequently switches the class being attacked during the search, allowing it to succeed by attacking different classes than Auto PGD gets stuck on. To quantify the search diversity, a new metric called Diversity Index (DI) is proposed based on graph clustering coefficients. Analyzing the DI shows ACG searches more extensively and diversely than Auto PGD. Overall the conjugate gradient directions provide much better exploration and attack performance compared to just gradient descent, especially with a proper balance of diversification and intensification in the search.
