# Summary

The document describes CWE-1256, a weakness related to improper restriction of software interfaces that control hardware features like power and clock management. This could enable attackers to modify memory or registers, or observe physical side channels, without needing physical access to the device. Examples are given such as the Rowhammer attack against DRAM and side channel attacks that leverage power measurement capabilities built into processors. The consequences can include modification of memory or application data and bypassing of protection mechanisms. Mitigations focus on ensuring proper access control for software interfaces that can alter physical operating conditions of hardware. 

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1256 relates to not properly restricting software interfaces that control hardware power, clock, etc.
* This could allow attackers to modify memory/registers or observe side channels without physical access. 
* Example attacks include Rowhammer against DRAM and power side channels using built-in measurement capabilities.
* Consequences include memory/data modification and bypassing protections.  
* Mitigations involve properly restricting software interfaces that can modify hardware operating conditions.
