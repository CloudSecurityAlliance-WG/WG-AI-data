Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes a weakness where a product accepts path input with a leading space (' filedir') without appropriate validation, which can allow attackers to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. This is due to the leading space causing ambiguous path resolution. It is a child of CWE-41 Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence.
