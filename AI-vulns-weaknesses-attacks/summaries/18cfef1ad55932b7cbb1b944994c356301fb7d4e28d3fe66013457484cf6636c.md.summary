Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-468, a weakness related to incorrect pointer scaling in C and C++ code. Specifically, it refers to cases where programmers incorrectly perform arithmetic operations on pointers, unintentionally accessing the wrong memory locations. This can lead to information leaks or unauthorized memory access. The root cause is that C and C++ implicitly scale pointer offsets by the size of the data type, which programmers often fail to consider. It can result in buffer overflows or over-reads/under-reads. The mitigations suggest using array indexing instead of direct pointer manipulation, platforms with higher-level abstractions, and technologies to prevent buffer overflows.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-468 refers to incorrect pointer scaling in C/C++ leading to accessing the wrong memory locations
* Occurs when programmers perform arithmetic operations on pointers without considering implicit scaling
* Can cause information leaks, unauthorized memory access, buffer overflows
* Suggested mitigations: use array indexing instead of direct pointer manipulation, use higher-level abstractions, employ buffer overflow prevention technologies
