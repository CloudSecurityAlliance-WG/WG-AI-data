# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-754 describes the weakness of a product not properly checking for or incorrectly checking unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to frequently occur during normal operation. This can violate assumptions made by developers and introduce instability, incorrect behavior, or vulnerabilities if attackers intentionally trigger these unusual conditions. Proper handling of return values from functions and exceptions is important to anticipate and handle unexpected situations.

Key aspects related to information security and AI security:

- Not checking return values from functions can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or vulnerabilities if error conditions occur but are not handled 
- Improper exception handling can allow attackers to trigger unusual conditions and bypass assumptions made by developers
- Exposing too much error information can help attackers optimize attacks, sensitive information should not be revealed
- Input validation helps minimize chances for attackers to trigger unusual conditions
- Failures should be handled gracefully to avoid cascading failures and loss of control

# Summary bullet points

* Product does not properly check for or incorrectly handles unusual or exceptional conditions that violate developers' assumptions
* Attackers can intentionally trigger unusual conditions, leading to instability, incorrect behavior, or vulnerabilities
* Not checking return values from functions can cause crashes, unexpected behavior if error conditions occur
* Improper exception handling allows attackers to trigger unusual conditions and bypass developersâ€TM assumptions 
* Exposing too much error information helps attackers optimize attacks
* Input validation minimizes chances to trigger unusual conditions
* Failures should be handled gracefully to avoid cascading issues or loss of control
