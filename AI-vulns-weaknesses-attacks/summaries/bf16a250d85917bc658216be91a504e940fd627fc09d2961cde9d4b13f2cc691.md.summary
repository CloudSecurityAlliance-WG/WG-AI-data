Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1039 weakness describes a vulnerability that can occur when an automated recognition system like machine learning is used to classify inputs, but does not properly detect or handle adversarial inputs designed to trigger incorrect classifications. This could allow attackers to craft malicious inputs that fool the system into making incorrect security decisions or granting excess privileges. Examples include image recognition for autonomous vehicles or speech recognition in voice assistants. The key factors are:

- Use of ML/AI for automated recognition of complex inputs like images or audio
- Inadequate testing/training to handle adversarial examples 
- Could enable attackers to bypass protections or gain privileges by forcing misclassifications

Main consequences are integrity issues from bypassing protections and gaining privileges. It relates conceptually to broader categories of protection mechanism failures. Targeted technologies include speech recognition, image recognition, autonomous vehicles, etc.
