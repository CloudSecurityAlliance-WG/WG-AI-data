Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content on insufficient entropy in common weakness enumeration CWE-331:

# Summary

The document describes the weakness of insufficient entropy in software algorithms that are intended to produce randomness. When entropy is insufficient, patterns or clusters emerge in the values generated, making them more predictable. This can enable attackers to more easily guess random values used for authentication, authorization, or other security purposes, allowing them to bypass protections. The document provides demonstrative code examples in PHP and Java showing insufficiently random session ID generation and receipt URL generation. It discusses the common consequences being attackers able to bypass access controls by guessing weak random values. Potential mitigations include determining necessary entropy levels and increasing the number of bits in keys/seeds to improve randomness. Relevant attack patterns like session credential falsification through prediction are referenced.

# Summary bullet points

* Insufficient entropy leaves patterns making random values more predictable 
* Can allow attackers to guess random numbers used for authentication/authorization
* Provides PHP and Java code examples showing weakness
* Common attack consequence is bypassing access controls
* Mitigations include increasing entropy and key/seed bit lengths
