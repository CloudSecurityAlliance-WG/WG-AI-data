# Summary

The text describes CWE-1093, a common weakness enumeration related to excessively complex data representation in software. It states that unnecessarily complex internal data structures or relationships between those structures makes software more difficult to understand and maintain, which indirectly affects security. It also can make it easier to introduce new vulnerabilities or make them harder to detect. CWE-1093 is child of improper coding standards and parent of several other entries related to too much complexity like deep inheritance hierarchies or excessive number of child classes.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1093 relates to excessively complex data representation in software causing maintainability and performance issues
* Complex structures are harder to understand and make fixing vulnerabilities more difficult
* Can also make it easier to introduce new vulnerabilities 
* Is child of improper coding standards CWE and parent of other "too complex" topics like deep inheritance and many child classes
* Indirectly relevant to security as complexity makes weaknesses harder to detect
* Impacts maintainability and performance
