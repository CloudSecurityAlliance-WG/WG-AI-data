Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-303 weakness describes an incorrect implementation of an established authentication algorithm that is required for a product. This could allow authentication to be bypassed. It is a child of weak authentication and a parent of missing critical steps in authentication. It is applicable across languages and platforms. The impact is accessing control bypass. An observed example is a conditional that should have been an "or" instead of an "and" in CVE-2003-0750. It is part of an authentication bypass cluster and comprehensive access control categorization. The operational mapping is realization during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
