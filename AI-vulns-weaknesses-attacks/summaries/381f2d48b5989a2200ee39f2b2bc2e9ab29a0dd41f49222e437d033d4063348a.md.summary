# Summary

The text describes CWE-608, a weakness related to the Struts web application framework in Java. Specifically, it refers to ActionForm classes in Struts that contain public fields instead of private fields. Having public fields exposes the data to unintended access and modification without using the proper getter and setter methods. The solution is to declare the fields private and provide getter and setter methods to control access. This prevents data from being changed unexpectedly from other parts of the application. The key concepts covered are proper encapsulation of data in Struts ActionForm beans using private fields and getter/setter methods. Having public fields violates secure coding best practices.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes CWE-608 - Struts ActionForm classes with public instead of private fields
* Public fields allow unintended data access and modification without getters/setters
* Better practice is to declare private fields and expose data through getters/setters  
* Getters and setters provide control over data access
* Preventing direct access to fields makes data less vulnerable to unintended changes
