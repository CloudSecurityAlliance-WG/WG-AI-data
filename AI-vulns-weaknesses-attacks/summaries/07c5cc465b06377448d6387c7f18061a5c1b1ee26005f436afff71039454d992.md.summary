Message:  # Summary

This text discusses potential threats and vulnerabilities related to AI/ML systems. It focuses on exploits that take advantage of software vulnerabilities rather than manipulating the AI algorithms directly. Specific threats mentioned include buffer overflows, cross-site scripting, and vulnerabilities in open source dependencies. There is a warning that crafted training data payloads could be used to compromise systems. Questions are posed to readers about whether they have mechanisms to identify failures and mitigate impacts. An example is given involving an AI system harming a patient due to performing some aspect of care incorrectly. Overall, the text serves to make readers aware of exploit-related risks to AI/ML systems, especially around software vulnerabilities and training data security. It advocates for having robust mechanisms to detect and respond to failures to limit harm. The geographic focus is not specifically stated.
