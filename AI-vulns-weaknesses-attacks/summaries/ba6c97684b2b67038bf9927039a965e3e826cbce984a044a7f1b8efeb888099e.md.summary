# Summary

The article describes the weakness of improper locking (CWE-667), which occurs when a product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a shared resource. This can lead to unexpected resource state changes, data corruption, denial of service, and other issues. It provides examples of improper locking in various languages like Java, PHP, and C. The key points are:

- Locking mechanisms like mutexes ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources. If locking discipline is not followed precisely, one thread could modify a shared resource in a way unseen by others.

- Not checking return values of lock functions can lead to undefined behavior and race conditions. 

- Inconsistent locking can lead to deadlocks where multiple threads get stuck waiting for locks held by each other.

- Double-checked locking in Java to avoid synchronization costs can lead to unexpected behavior if timing allows another thread to access partially constructed object.

Proper use of industry standard locking APIs is recommended to avoid issues. Static analysis can also detect some locking weakness instances by modeling data and control flow.

# Summary bullet points

* Locking mechanisms like mutexes ensure thread safety for shared resources, must follow strict discipline
* Not checking lock function return values can lead to race conditions 
* Inconsistent locking can cause deadlocks between threads
* Attempts to avoid synchronization costs via double-checked locking in Java can fail
* Recommends using standard locking APIs, static analysis also useful for detection
* Examples in Java, PHP, C code showing dangers
* Can lead to data corruption, denial of service, undefined behavior
