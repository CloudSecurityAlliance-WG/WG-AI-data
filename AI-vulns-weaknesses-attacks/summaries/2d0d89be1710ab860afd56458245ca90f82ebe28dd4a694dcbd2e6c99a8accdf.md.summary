# Summary

The paper introduces a new method to generate "adversarial images" that appear perceptually similar to a source image but have internal representations in a deep neural network (DNN) that mimic that of a different "guide" image. The method involves optimizing a small perturbation to the source image to minimize the distance between the DNN representations of the perturbed image and the guide, while constraining the perturbation to be imperceptible. 

The resulting adversarial images are shown to have representations at intermediate DNN layers that closely resemble their respective guide images in terms of nearest neighbors, density within the feature space, and other metrics. However, they remain virtually indistinguishable from the source image to humans. This demonstrates that DNNs can be easily fooled to associate entirely different semantic concepts to what are essentially the same natural images.

The authors find that these "feature adversaries" exhibit different properties compared to other categories of adversarial images optimized for misclassification. The phenomenon does not seem to be explained by the "linearity hypothesis," and persists even with random network weights, suggesting it may originate from intrinsic attributes of the architectural structure itself.
