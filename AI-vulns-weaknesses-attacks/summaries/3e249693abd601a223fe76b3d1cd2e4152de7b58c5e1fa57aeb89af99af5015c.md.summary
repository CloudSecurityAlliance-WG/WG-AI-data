Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-353 weakness describes when a product uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of data during transmission, such as a checksum. This means there is no way to determine if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksums removes the first application-level check that could detect corrupted data. This impacts data integrity and non-repudiation, as changes to data cannot be detected. 

The mitigations suggest adding an appropriately sized checksum to the protocol to validate data before use. Checksums should be properly implemented on each message sent.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-353 refers to missing checksums or other integrity checks in network transmission protocols
* This prevents detection of corrupted data and hides changes made to data
* Mitigations include adding checksums to protocol messages before sending
* Checksums provide first application-level validation of data integrity
* Impacts data integrity and non-repudiation capabilities
