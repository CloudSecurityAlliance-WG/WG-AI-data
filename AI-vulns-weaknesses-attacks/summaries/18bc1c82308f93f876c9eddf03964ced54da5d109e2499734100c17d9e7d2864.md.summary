# Summary

The document describes CWE-925, a weakness related to the improper verification of intents received by broadcast receivers in Android applications. It explains that broadcast receivers meant to receive implicit system intents sent by the Android OS can also receive explicit intents from third-party apps. If the receiver does not properly verify that the intent is from the system, this can lead to unintended behavior and potential security issues. 

The document provides examples of vulnerable code where a broadcast receiver registers to receive the system's ACTION_SHUTDOWN intent but does not verify the intent action before triggering application shutdown. This could allow a malicious app to send an intent that tricks the app into shutting down. Recommended mitigations include checking the intent action string to verify it matches expected system actions before acting on the intent.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-925 relates to improper verification of intents by Android broadcast receivers 
* Broadcast receivers can receive implicit intents from the system and explicit intents from apps
* Not verifying intent source can lead to unintended behavior if malicious intents are received
* Example shows receiver for shutdown intent that doesn't check action before shutting down app
* Mitigation is to check intent action string before acting to ensure it's from the expected system action
