Message:  # Summary

The document provides an overview of PLOT4ai, which is a library containing 86 threats related to AI/ML systems. The threats are classified into 8 different categories. The document encourages readers who are new to PLOT4ai to read the "HOW TO" section first to understand how to use the library. 

The main focus of the content seems to be around legal and ethical risks associated with using AI systems, particularly risks related to harming individuals whose data is used to build the systems. There is a repeated question about whether a third party tool will be used, noting that even if a third party tool is used, the organization deploying the AI still has responsibility for potential harms. The takeaway seems to be that it's critical for organizations to carefully evaluate potential risks before deploying AI to avoid legal, ethical, or security issues.
