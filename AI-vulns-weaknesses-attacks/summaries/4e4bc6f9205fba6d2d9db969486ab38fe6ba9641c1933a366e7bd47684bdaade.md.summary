# Summary

The content describes the CWE-252 weakness, which is about unchecked return values from functions and methods. It occurs when software does not properly check the return values from functions and methods to detect error conditions or unexpected states. This can lead to vulnerabilities if attackers can intentionally cause functions to fail or return unexpected values. 

The key points related to information security and AI security are:

- Unchecked return values can leave software in an unexpected state that attackers could exploit to cause crashes, bypass security checks, etc.
- Important functions like those for dropping privileges, file/socket operations, memory allocation, etc. should have their return values checked. 
- Race conditions may still occur even if return values are checked, so multi-threaded/concurrent programs need additional protections.
- Static analysis tools can automatically detect instances of unchecked return values.

So in summary, properly handling return values is an important secure coding practice to avoid vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

# Summary bullet points

* Unchecked return values leave software in unexpected states that attackers can exploit
* Can lead to crashes, bypassing of security checks, info leaks, etc. 
* Important for functions that drop privileges, file/socket operations, memory allocation, etc.
* Check all return values and handle errors properly
* But race conditions may still occur so concurrent programs need additional protections  
* Static analysis tools can automatically detect unchecked return values
