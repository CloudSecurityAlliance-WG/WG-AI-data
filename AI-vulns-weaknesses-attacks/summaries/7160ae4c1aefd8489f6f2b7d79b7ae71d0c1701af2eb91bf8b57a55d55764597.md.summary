Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-82 describes an improper neutralization of scripting elements within HTML image (IMG) tag attributes, such as the source (SRC) attribute, in a web page. Attackers can embed cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits into IMG tag attribute values, which get executed when the page loads in a victim's browser. This can lead to the attacker reading sensitive application data or executing unauthorized code or commands. Examples of real-world vulnerabilities mapped to CWE-82 are provided, along with potential mitigations like output encoding, setting the HTTP-only cookie flag, and attack surface reduction.
