Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1091 weakness describes a situation where a software product accesses an object but fails to later invoke the object's associated finalize/destructor method. This can reduce performance by retaining memory and resources longer than necessary. If reachable by an attacker, it could introduce a vulnerability. It is related to insufficient adherence to expected conventions and missing release of resources after their effective lifetime. The impact is reduced performance.
