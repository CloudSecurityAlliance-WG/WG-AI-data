Message:  # Summary

The CWE-135 weakness describes an issue where software incorrectly calculates the length of strings containing multi-byte or wide characters. This can lead to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds memory access when those incorrect lengths are used for memory allocation and copy operations. Specifically, using byte-based string functions like strlen() on multi-byte strings will produce incorrect lengths. This can result in allocating too little memory when copying strings and lead to buffer overflows. Mixing standard and multi-byte string functions can also cause issues. Proper validation of string lengths using the correct multi-byte functions like wcslen() is recommended to prevent problems.
