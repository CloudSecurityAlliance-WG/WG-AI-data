# Summary

The document describes the CWE-123 weakness related to write-what-where conditions in software. These occur when an attacker can write arbitrary values to arbitrary memory locations, often due to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes. This enables attackers to modify critical data or redirect code execution, allowing arbitrary code execution or bypassing security mechanisms. Common consequences include crashing programs, gaining privileges, and compromising confidentiality/integrity. Examples demonstrate exploiting allocation header overwrites and mitigations focus on memory safety through language selection and runtime protections.  

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-123 refers to write-what-where conditions enabling attackers to write arbitrary values to arbitrary memory locations.
* Commonly occurs due to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes.
* Enables attackers to modify critical data or redirect code execution for exploitation.
* Consequences include crashes, privilege escalation, code execution, security bypass.  
* Examples show overwriting allocation header data structures.
* Mitigations involve using memory safe languages and runtime protections.
