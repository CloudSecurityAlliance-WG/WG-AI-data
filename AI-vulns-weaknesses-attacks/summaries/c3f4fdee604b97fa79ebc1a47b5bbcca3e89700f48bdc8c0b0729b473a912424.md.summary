# Summary

The content describes an issue called "Incorrect Use of Autoboxing and Unboxing for Performance Critical Operations" (CWE-1235) in programming languages like Java and C#. Autoboxing and unboxing allow automatic conversion between primitive data types (like int) and their corresponding wrapper object types (like Integer). While convenient, using boxed primitives can significantly reduce performance in critical operations. This can lead to resource consumption issues that impact availability. Performance-critical code should avoid using boxed primitives when primitive types would suffice.

The issue is considered a weakness that can lead to vulnerabilities if exploited, such as denial of service attacks through resource exhaustion. It stems from the use of boxed primitives where not strictly necessary. The mitigation is to limit use of boxed primitives and examine code for unnecessary usage, replacing with primitive types where applicable. This is especially important in performance-sensitive operations.

# Summary bullet points

* Autoboxing and unboxing allow automatic conversion between primitives and objects in Java/C#
* Using boxed primitives can reduce performance significantly
* Performance impact can lead to resource consumption/availability issues 
* Weakness that can enable denial of service attacks if exploited
* Caused by unnecessary usage of boxed primitives
* Mitigation is to limit usage and replace with primitives where possible
* Especially important to avoid in performance-critical code
