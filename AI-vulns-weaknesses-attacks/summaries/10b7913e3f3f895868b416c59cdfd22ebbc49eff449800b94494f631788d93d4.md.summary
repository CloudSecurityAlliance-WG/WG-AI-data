# Summary

The document describes CWE-586, a common weakness related to explicitly calling the finalize() method from outside the finalizer in Java code. This goes against the Java Language Specification and can lead to issues such as finalize() being called more than once. The document advises not making explicit finalize() calls and using static analysis tools to detect instances of this weakness.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-586 involves explicitly calling finalize() from outside the finalizer in Java code, which goes against conventions
* This can lead to issues like finalize() being called more than once 
* The Java Language Specification allows it but it is still a bad practice
* Potential mitigations include not making explicit finalize() calls and using static analysis tools
* It is a child of CWE-1076 Insufficient Adherence to Expected Conventions and a peer of CWE-675 Multiple Operations on Resource in Single-Operation Context
