Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content:

# Summary

The content describes an information security weakness (CWE-181) related to performing input validation before input filtering. This can allow attackers to bypass the validation and exploit vulnerabilities that would have otherwise been prevented. The key concepts are:

- Input should be decoded and canonicalized before filtering to avoid bypassing validation checks. 
- An example is provided where a PHP script filters out "." and ".." directory traversal attempts but does the filtering after validation. An attacker can use ".~" which gets filtered to ".." after validation, allowing directory traversal.
- This weakness enables attacks like injection attacks, path traversal, etc by bypassing validation checks.
- Proper secure coding practices dictate validating inputs after filtering/sanitizing and canonicalizing them.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes the CWE-181 weakness of incorrect behavior order by validating inputs before filtering
* Leads to bypassing of validation checks by transforming malicious inputs after validation 
* Enables attacks like injection, path traversal by bypassing validation
* Should decode/canonicalize inputs before validation 
* Provides a PHP example that is vulnerable to directory traversal by this weakness 
* Validating untrusted inputs after filtering is a secure coding best practice
