Message:  # Summary

The article discusses the tactic of unsecured credentials, where adversaries search compromised systems to find insecurely stored credentials that can be used to further access or control systems. It notes credentials may be stored in plaintext files, environment variables, operating systems, applications, registries or other locations. The article references the MITRE ATT&CK framework's T1152 technique for unsecured credentials and provides a case study link showing how vulnerabilities in AI systems like MathGPT could allow code execution via prompt injection to steal credentials. 

Overall, the article highlights the risks of improperly secured credentials on systems and how adversaries actively seek out these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, access data, or conduct other malicious activities. Properly storing and securing credentials is critical, especially for sensitive systems like AI and machine learning platforms that may have increased access or capabilities.
