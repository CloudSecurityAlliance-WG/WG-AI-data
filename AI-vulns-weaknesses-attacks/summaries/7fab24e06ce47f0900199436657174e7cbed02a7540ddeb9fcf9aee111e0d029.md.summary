# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-1116 describes the weakness of inaccurate code comments in software. Specifically, it refers to comments that do not accurately describe or explain the associated code. Inaccurate comments introduce confusion for code reviewers and make it more difficult to validate intended behavior and maintain the software over time. This reduces security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. 

CWE-1116 is considered a child weakness of CWE-1078 - Inappropriate Source Code Style or Formatting and a member of CWE-1006 - Bad Coding Practices. It is applicable to all programming languages.

The provided examples demonstrate inaccurate comments versus corrected comments to properly reflect the code's purpose. Potential mitigations include verifying each comment matches the relevant code's intended behavior during execution.
