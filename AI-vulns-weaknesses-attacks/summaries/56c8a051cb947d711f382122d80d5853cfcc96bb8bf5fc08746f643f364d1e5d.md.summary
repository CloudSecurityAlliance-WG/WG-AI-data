Message:  # Summary

This text discusses the importance of verifying data sources and lineage when working with AI systems. It explains that without proper verification of data sources, AI systems are at risk of using incorrectly labeled or illegitimate data. This could undermine trust in the system and negatively impact performance. Key points include:

- Data lineage tracing allows for transparency around where data comes from and how it flows through the system. This builds trust.
- All data sources should be verified for legitimacy before being used. Lack of verification risks the AI getting bad data.  
- Companies need to identify data owners, get usage agreements in place with them, and ensure they are allowed to collect/use the data.
- Answering "no" or "not sure" to the above considerations indicates risk in the AI data pipeline.

Overall, the text emphasizes properly tracking data provenance and getting usage rights as crucial for developing ethical, performant AI systems.
