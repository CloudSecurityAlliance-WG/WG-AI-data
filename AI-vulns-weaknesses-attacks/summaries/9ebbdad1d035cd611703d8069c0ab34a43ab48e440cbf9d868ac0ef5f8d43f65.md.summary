Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-208 weakness describes an observable timing discrepancy vulnerability where two separate operations in a product take different amounts of time to complete in a way that is observable to an attacker. This timing difference reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether an operation was successful. Attackers can exploit even small timing variations to infer details about internal operations, like cryptographic key properties. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel that can be used to bypass protections.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-208 refers to an observable timing discrepancy vulnerability where the time taken for operations leaks security-relevant data.
* Timing differences can be exploited by attackers to infer internal details and bypass protections. 
* This is common in cryptographic algorithms where timing variations reveal properties of private keys.
* Timing side channels allow attackers to indirectly access application data and break protections.
* Fixes include comparing entire data strings at once or masking timing differences from attackers.
