Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-32 weakness describes a path traversal vulnerability where external input is used to construct a file path that should be restricted, but fails to properly handle "..." sequences that can traverse outside the intended directory. This allows attackers to access files and directories outside the restricted location. On Windows, "..." acts as "..\" making it effective for bypassing some protections. Incomplete input filtering like only removing "./" can also leave dangerous ".." sequences.

# Summary bullet points

* External input used to build file paths without properly neutralizing "..." sequences 
* Allows traversing outside intended file system directories
* Useful for bypassing some Windows path protections by acting as "..\"
* Incomplete input filtering can fail to remove dangerous ".." sequences
* Allows attackers unauthorized file and directory access
* Applicable across multiple languages and platforms
