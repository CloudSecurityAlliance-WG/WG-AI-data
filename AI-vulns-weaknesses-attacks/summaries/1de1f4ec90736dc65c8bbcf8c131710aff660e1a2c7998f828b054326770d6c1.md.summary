# Summary

The paper proposes a new method called Elastic-Net Attacks to DNNs (EAD) for crafting adversarial examples to attack deep neural networks (DNNs). Adversarial examples are inputs to DNNs that are designed to cause misclassification while being virtually indistinguishable from legitimate inputs. 

The EAD attack is based on an elastic-net regularization approach that balances L1 and L2 distortion metrics between the adversarial and original examples. Using L1 regularization helps encourage sparsity in the perturbation applied to craft adversarial examples.

Experiments demonstrate that EAD can achieve attack success rates comparable to state-of-the-art L2 attacks on undefended and defensively distilled DNNs on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.

Key advantages of the L1-based EAD attack:
- Improved attack transferability from an undefended to defensively distilled DNN
- Complements adversarial training, with joint training on L1 and L2 adversarial examples further improving DNN resilience

The effectiveness of EAD underscores vulnerabilities in DNNs to adversarial inputs. The paper highlights the need to develop more robust DNNs and adversarial machine learning techniques.
