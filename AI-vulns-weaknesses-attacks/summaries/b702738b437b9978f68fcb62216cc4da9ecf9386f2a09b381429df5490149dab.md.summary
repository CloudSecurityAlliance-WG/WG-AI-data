Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1122 weakness describes excessive Halstead complexity in code, which makes the code more difficult to understand and maintain. This can indirectly reduce security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. The Halstead complexity measures evaluate program vocabulary size and volume as indicators of complexity. High Halstead complexity is considered a code quality issue rather than a direct security weakness.
