Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-446 weakness describes a situation where the user interface of a system does not correctly enable or configure a security feature, but provides feedback that leads the user to believe the feature is properly set up and secured. This can give users a false sense of security. Examples are enabling encryption but not actually turning it on, or claiming to restrict access but only limiting some access. This discrepancy between the UI and the actual system behavior can make the system more vulnerable to attacks.
