# Summary

The document describes a software weakness (CWE-1047) related to circular dependencies between software modules. This means modules reference each other in a circular way, making the software more complex and harder to maintain. 

This weakness can reduce software reliability and make it easier to introduce security vulnerabilities that are harder to detect. It also causes maintainability issues that could slow incident response if vulnerabilities are found.

# Summary bullet points
