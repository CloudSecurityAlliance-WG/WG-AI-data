# Summary

The content describes the weakness CWE-377 related to the creation and use of insecure temporary files. It explains that creating and using temporary files insecurely can leave application and system data vulnerable to attack. Common consequences include compromised confidentiality and integrity if attackers can read or modify the temporary files. Creating predictable file names or insecure permissions make the files vulnerable. Examples are provided of insecure use of functions like tmpfile() and recommendations made for more secure alternatives like mkstemp().

# Summary bullet points

* Creating and using temporary files insecurely leaves data vulnerable to attackers
* Common consequences are loss of confidentiality and integrity of data
* Insecurely created predictable file names allow attackers to access files
