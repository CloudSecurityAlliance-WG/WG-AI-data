This can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow attackers to access unintended files or directories. It is a variant of improper neutralization of multiple trailing special elements (CWE-163) and trailing dot (CWE-42). The impact includes reading/modifying unintended files. It has led to vulnerabilities like CVE-2004-0281 that allowed directory listings.
