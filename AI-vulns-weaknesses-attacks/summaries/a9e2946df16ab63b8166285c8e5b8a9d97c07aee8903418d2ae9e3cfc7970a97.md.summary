Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1078 weakness describes inappropriate source code style or formatting that does not follow best practices for things like indentation, whitespace, comments, naming conventions, etc. While these may be quality issues that can indirectly enable vulnerabilities, they do not have direct security implications. Some examples are using hard-coded constants instead of symbolic names, inconsistent naming conventions, inappropriate comments, and improper whitespace. The key point is that following best practices for source code style and formatting makes code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.
