# Summary

The document describes CWE-637 - Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism'), which is a weakness where a product uses a more complex security mechanism than necessary. This can lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not properly understood, modeled, configured, implemented or used. The key points are:

- Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible to avoid bugs, partial implementations, and incompatibilities. 
- Complex specifications result in complex validation code, increasing risk.
- Simpler systems should be preferred from a security perspective.
- Strategies to mitigate include avoiding unnecessary complexity, modularizing complex code, and applying secure programming principles.

# Summary bullet points

* Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible to avoid resultant weaknesses from improper implementation.
* Complex mechanisms may lead to bugs, partial implementations, and vendor incompatibilities. 
* Complex data models and operations also increase risk.
* Simpler systems should be preferred from a security perspective.
* Mitigations include avoiding unnecessary complexity, modularizing complex code, and using secure programming principles.
