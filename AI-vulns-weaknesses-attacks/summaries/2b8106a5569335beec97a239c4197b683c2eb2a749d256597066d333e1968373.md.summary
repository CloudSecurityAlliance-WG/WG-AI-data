# Summary

The paper proposes Square Attack, a score-based black-box adversarial attack that does not rely on gradient information and thus avoids issues with gradient masking defenses. The attack is based on a randomized search scheme that selects localized square-shaped updates at random image positions, so perturbations are situated at the boundary of the allowed norm ball. Experiments across MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show Square Attack requires significantly fewer queries to find adversarial examples compared to prior state-of-the-art, especially for untargeted attacks. On ImageNet, query efficiency improves by at least 1.8x and up to 3x over the best prior method. Despite being black-box, Square Attack can also outperform white-box attacks, achieving state-of-the-art robust test accuracy on defended MNIST models. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for a variant of the method. Design choices like square regions and constant sign are motivated by maximizing activation change in early network layers.
