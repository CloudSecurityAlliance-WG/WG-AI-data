# Summary

The document describes CWE-48, a weakness related to path equivalence when a product accepts path input containing internal whitespace (e.g. 'file(SPACE)name') without appropriate validation. This can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. It is a child of CWE-41 Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence. The impact includes the ability for an attacker to read or modify files and directories. Examples are provided such as a filename with spaces allowing arbitrary file deletion or "+" characters being converted to spaces, allowing bypass of access restrictions.

The document explains this is likely to overlap with quoting problems (CWE-428) and issues related to filtering that removes spaces. It also notes whitespace can enable other weaknesses like spoofing icons or hiding dangerous filenames.
