Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-577 weakness describes violations of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification related to improper use of sockets. Specifically, the EJB specification prohibits EJBs from attempting to listen on sockets, accept socket connections, or use sockets for multicast. This is because EJBs are meant to serve EJB clients in a distributed architecture, not act as network servers themselves. Allowing EJBs to become network servers would conflict with their intended purpose. The weakness can lead to quality degradation and other technical impacts.

The provided examples demonstrate EJBs improperly creating ServerSocket objects, accepting client connections, and processing input over those sockets. This violates the specification. Potential mitigations include not using sockets at all when coding EJBs.  

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-577 refers to improper use of sockets within Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), violating the EJB specification
* EJB specification prohibits EJBs from listening on sockets, accepting socket connections, or using multicast sockets
* This would conflict with EJBs' purpose of serving EJB clients in a distributed architecture
* Can lead to quality degradation and technical issues
* Examples show EJBs opening sockets, accepting connections, reading input - violates spec
* Mitigations include avoiding use of sockets entirely when coding EJBs
