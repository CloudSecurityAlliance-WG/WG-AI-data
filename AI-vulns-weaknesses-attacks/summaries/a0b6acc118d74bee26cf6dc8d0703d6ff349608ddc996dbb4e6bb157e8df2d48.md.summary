# Summary

The content describes the weakness of improper neutralization of input during web page generation, also known as cross-site scripting (XSS). It provides a detailed explanation of how XSS attacks work by allowing untrusted data to enter a web application and be reflected back to users without proper neutralization, enabling malicious scripts to execute. 

The content outlines three main types of XSS:

1. Reflected XSS: Untrusted data from a request is reflected back in the response. Attackers can trick victims into supplying dangerous content and executing it.

2. Stored XSS: Dangerous data is stored and later read back into the app and included in dynamic content returned to users. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that victims may execute at a later time.

3. DOM-based XSS: Occurs when the client performs injection of XSS into the page instead of the server. Typically involves malicious scripts being injected via a trusted, server-supplied script.

The content provides several examples demonstrating each type of XSS vulnerability. It also suggests various mitigation strategies involving input validation, output encoding, attack surface reduction, firewalls, and proper framework usage.

# Summary bullet points

* XSS flaws allow untrusted input to be reflected back to users without neutralization, enabling malicious client-side code execution
* Occurs when output generated from untrusted input is used to dynamically construct web pages returned to users 
* Three main types: reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS 
* Can lead to compromise of user accounts, sensitive data theft, phishing, or malware execution
* Proper input validation and output encoding can help prevent XSS
* Should encode all non-alphanumeric output characters depending on context 
* Accept only known good input using allowlists 
* Use frameworks with built-in XSS protections
* Reduce attack surface by limiting inputs
* Use firewalls to detect attacks
