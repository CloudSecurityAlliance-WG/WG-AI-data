# Summary

The text describes CWE-1421, a type of hardware weakness where transient operations in a processor can access restricted data cached in shared microarchitectural structures, potentially exposing sensitive data over a covert channel. Many processors have ISA features like segmentation and virtualization to enforce boundaries between software components. However, microarchitectural resources like CPU caches are often shared across contexts. If transient execution allows access to private data in these shared structures, attackers could exploit covert channels to infer the data. Examples are given like speculative loads accessing kernel memory in user mode, thread crossover in fill buffers, and restricted system registers read during transient execution. Suggested mitigations include partitioning/sanitizing microarchitectural state, restricting high-resolution timers, and various hardware, software, and configuration changes. Detection methods include manual analysis of specs, taint tracking, fuzzing, and checking for processor errata.

# Summary bullet points

* Processors have ISA features for memory isolation, but microarchitectural state like caches is often shared across contexts
* Transient execution could allow access to private data in shared structures, leaking it over covert channels
* Examples include speculative user mode access to kernel data, fill buffer crossover between threads, restricted system register reads 
* Mitigations involve partitioning caches/buffers, sanitizing state on context switches, restricting timers, hardware/firmware/software changes
* Can be detected via manual analysis, taint tracking, fuzzing, checking processor errata
