Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-924 describes an issue related to improper enforcement of message integrity during transmission over a communication channel. Specifically, it refers to a situation where a product establishes communication with an endpoint and receives a message, but does not sufficiently verify that the message has not been altered during transmission. This enables attackers to modify the message and potentially assume the identity of or gain privileges intended for the original endpoint. 

Key aspects highlighted include:

- Failure to ensure integrity of messages received over a communication channel enables spoofing and tampering
- Can enable privilege escalation if attackers assume identity of privileged endpoint 
- Related to insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345) and communication channel errors (CWE-417)
- Can allow attackers to gain confidential information through tampering
- Important design issue that likely underlies other weaknesses
