Message:  # Summary

Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are intentional manipulations of input data to cause misclassifications or incorrect predictions. These attacks exploit weaknesses in neural networks by making small, imperceptible changes to input data that cause the network to make mistakes. Types of attacks include perturbation-based attacks that add noise, exploration-based attacks that find vulnerabilities, and backdoor attacks that add hidden triggers. Defending against these attacks remains an active area of research, with techniques like adversarial training, defensive distillation, and ensemble methods showing promise. However, more work is still needed to make neural networks robust to adversarial threats. As long as vulnerabilities remain, it is important that precautions are taken when deploying neural networks, especially in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.
