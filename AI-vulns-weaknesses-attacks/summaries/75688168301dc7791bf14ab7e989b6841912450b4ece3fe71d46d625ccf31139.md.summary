# Summary

The document describes CWE-627, a weakness related to dynamic variable evaluation in programming languages. It explains that in languages where variable names can be influenced at runtime, an attacker could potentially read/write arbitrary variables or access functions if the names are not properly controlled. This could lead to unauthorized access or code execution. The document mainly focuses on PHP as an affected language but notes that others are as well. It provides examples of vulnerabilities linked to CWE-627 and recommendations for refactoring code to avoid it through input validation and allowlists. The key takeaway is that dynamically evaluating variables based on user input can be dangerous and should be avoided where possible.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-627 relates to dynamic variable evaluation in languages like PHP where variable names can be influenced at runtime
* If variable names are not controlled, this could allow attackers access to arbitrary variables/functions
* Can lead to unauthorized data access, code execution, and other exploits 
* Examples provided of chains starting from CWE-627
* Mitigations focus on refactoring code, input validation, allowlists
* Under-studied but likely to increase as register_globals is removed
* Mainly seen in PHP but other languages affected too
