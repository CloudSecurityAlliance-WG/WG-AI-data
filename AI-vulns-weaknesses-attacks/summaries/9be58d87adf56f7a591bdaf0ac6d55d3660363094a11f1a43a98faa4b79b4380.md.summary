Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes the weakness of relying on third-party software components that do not provide equivalent functionality across all desirable platforms. This makes it more difficult to maintain the product and indirectly affects security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce new vulnerabilities.
