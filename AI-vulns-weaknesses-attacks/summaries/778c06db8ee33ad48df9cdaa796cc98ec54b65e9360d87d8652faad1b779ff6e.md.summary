Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a weakness in ASP.NET applications where improperly configured impersonation allows the application to run with unnecessary privileges. This can allow the application access beyond what it requires to function, violating the principle of least privilege. It is categorized as incorrect privilege assignment, allowing the application privileges it does not need. This misconfiguration could enable escalation of privileges or assuming other identities. The mitigation is to properly restrict privileges per the least privilege principle when configuring ASP.NET impersonation.
