Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-771 weakness describes a situation where a product fails to properly maintain a reference to an allocated resource, preventing the resource from being reclaimed later. This can lead to resource exhaustion if left unchecked, allowing attackers to launch denial-of-service attacks by depleting available resources. Proper reference tracking and resource management, including garbage collection, can mitigate this weakness.

# Summary bullet points

* Child of CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
