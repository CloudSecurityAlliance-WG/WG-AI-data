Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the text:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-1041: Use of Redundant Code. This refers to when software has multiple functions, methods, procedures, macros, etc. that contain duplicate code. This makes the software more difficult to maintain and indirectly affects security by making it harder to find and fix vulnerabilities. For example, if a vulnerability exists in one copy of code, a developer may fix it in that instance but forget to fix it in the other redundant copies. The text provides a Java code example to demonstrate this weakness, where the same complex math equations are repeated unnecessarily instead of refactoring them into a separate function. It then shows an improved version where the equations are placed in a `ComplexMath()` function that is called when needed.

Potential mitigations include refactoring any duplicate code blocks into common functions that can be called from anywhere they are needed. This avoids repetition and reduces maintenance effort.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1041 refers to duplicate code blocks spread across multiple functions/methods instead of shared common functions
* Makes software harder to maintain and indirectly harms security
* Developers may fix bugs/vulnerabilities in one instance of code but miss others 
* Shown in Java example with duplicate complex math equations
* Improved by refactoring into `ComplexMath()` function and calling it when needed
* Mitigate by consolidating duplicate code into common functions
