# Summary

The document describes CWE-805, a weakness related to buffer access with an incorrect length value. Specifically, it involves a software product using a sequential operation to read or write to a buffer, but an incorrect length value is used that causes accessing memory outside the buffer's bounds. This can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, modification of memory, and execution of arbitrary code. Mitigations focus on language selection, validation of length values, use of safe libraries, address space randomization, data execution prevention, sandboxing, and environment hardening techniques.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-805 involves accessing a buffer with an incorrect length value, leading to out-of-bounds access
* Can result in buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, modification of memory, and execution of arbitrary code
* Occurs when sequential operations use incorrect length values to operate on buffers
* Mitigations include language selection, validation, safe libraries, address randomization, data execution prevention, sandboxing
* Hardening environment using protections like stack canaries, bounds checking, lower privileges can help
