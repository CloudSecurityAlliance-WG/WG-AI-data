Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-614, a weakness related to not setting the secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions. This causes the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session, exposing sensitive data. It is a variant of cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). The impact is that it allows remote attackers to more easily capture sensitive cookie data that should have been protected by HTTPS.
