# Summary

The document describes CWE-1124, a common weakness enumeration related to excessively deep nesting in code. It states that code with very deep levels of nesting or branching is more difficult to maintain and indirectly affects security by making vulnerabilities harder to find and fix. The deep nesting also increases code complexity, making the introduction of new vulnerabilities more likely. As such, CWE-1124 is considered more of a quality issue rather than a direct security weakness.
