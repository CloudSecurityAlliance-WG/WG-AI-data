# Summary

The CWE-839 weakness occurs when a product checks that a numeric value is less than or equal to a maximum value, but fails to also check that the value is greater than or equal to a minimum value. This can result in unintended negative values being used in operations where only positive values are expected. The consequences include incorrect calculations, resource consumption issues, buffer overflows, out of bounds memory access, and other memory corruption vulnerabilities. Attackers could potentially exploit these issues to crash systems, execute arbitrary code, or gain unauthorized access. 

Key mitigations include converting variables from signed to unsigned types where only positive values are expected, and adding input validation checks to ensure values fall within both an appropriate minimum and maximum range.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-839 stems from products checking numeric values against a maximum but not a minimum
* Can result in unintended negative values where positive values are expected
* Consequences include incorrect calculations, resource issues, buffer overflows, out of bounds access
* Attackers could exploit to crash systems, execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access
* Mitigations include variable type conversion and input validation for min/max range
