# Summary

The weakness described is related to debug and test interfaces in hardware products that support multiple access levels. The issue arises when internal assets are incorrectly assigned a debug access level that provides unintended access to those assets from untrusted debug agents. This could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from internal assets through the use of a debugger. 

The extended description explains that debug authorization can have multiple access levels defined such that different internal system assets are accessible based on the current debug access level. Full system debug access may only be allowed early in the boot process to prevent access to previous session data. If debug access levels are not properly ensured during boot and system state changes, attackers could gain unintended access to sensitive internal assets.

# Summary bullet points

* Debug and test interfaces may support multiple access levels to control access to internal assets 
* Assets can be incorrectly assigned debug access levels providing unintended access
* Attackers could use this to access sensitive information with a debugger
* Debug access control should be properly implemented during boot and system state changes
