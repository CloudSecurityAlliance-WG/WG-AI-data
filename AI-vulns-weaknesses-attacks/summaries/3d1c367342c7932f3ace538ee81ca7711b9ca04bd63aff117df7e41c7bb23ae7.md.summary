# Summary

The document describes CWE-491, a weakness related to the cloneable() method in Java classes. Specifically, it refers to classes that have a public cloneable() method that is not declared final. This allows objects to be created without calling the constructor, which can cause the object to be in an unexpected state. The key mitigation is to make the cloneable() method final.
