Message:  # Summary

Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page is a weakness where a web page fails to properly sanitize user input that could be interpreted as server-side include (SSI) directives. This allows attackers to inject SSI directives to execute unauthorized code or commands on the server. It can result in compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability. This is a variant of the broader Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code weakness. It is relevant to injection vulnerabilities and improper neutralization of input.
