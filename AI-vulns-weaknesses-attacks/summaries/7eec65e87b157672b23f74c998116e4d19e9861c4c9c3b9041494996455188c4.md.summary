# Summary

The document describes CWE-1025, a weakness related to performing comparisons between two entities using the wrong factors or characteristics. This can lead to incorrect results and weaknesses. Examples are provided such as inadvertently comparing object references instead of object contents in Java code, causing two "equal" objects to be considered unequal. 

The key mitigation is to thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code to production, including both positive and negative testing.
