Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-148, a common weakness enumeration related to improper neutralization of input leaders. Specifically, it refers to when a software system does not properly handle missing, malformed, or multiple leading characters or sequences that should only occur once to start an input. This can lead to unexpected system states and behaviors. 

The key points are:

- Leading special characters or sequences that denote the start of an input are not properly validated. The system allows inputs with missing, malformed, or multiple leaders.

- This can enable attackers to bypass validation checks and access unexpected system states. It is a variant of improper neutralization of special elements (CWE-138).

- Consequences relate to integrity and technical impact through unexpected system state.

- Mitigations focus on proper input validation, escaping/filtering special characters, and canonicalizing inputs before validation.

# Summary bullet points

* Does not properly handle missing, malformed, or multiple input leaders
* Enables attackers to bypass protections and access unexpected states 
* ChildOf improper neutralization of special elements (CWE-138)
* Leads to integrity issues and unexpected technical states
* Mitigate via input validation, output encoding, allowlisting
* Preferred level of abstraction for mapping vulnerabilities
