Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-283, a common weakness enumeration related to unverified ownership. Specifically, it refers to when a product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned by the proper entity. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and privileges.

The example provided is of a Python function that kills a process based on a process ID passed to it. The original flawed version does not check that the requesting user actually owns the process being killed. This could let a user kill arbitrary processes they don't own. The improved version adds a check to validate the requesting user owns the process before killing it.

Potential mitigations include carefully managing privileges and trust zones in the software, enforcing separation of privilege principles, and requiring multiple conditions to be met before granting access to system resources.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-283 refers to unverified ownership, when products don't check critical resources are owned by proper entities
* This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and privileges by accessing resources they shouldn't have access to
* Example shows Python function to kill a process that doesn't check if requesting user owns that process
* Improved version checks ownership before killing process to prevent killing arbitrary processes
* Mitigations include managing privileges carefully, enforcing separation of privilege principles, and requiring multiple conditions before granting resource access
