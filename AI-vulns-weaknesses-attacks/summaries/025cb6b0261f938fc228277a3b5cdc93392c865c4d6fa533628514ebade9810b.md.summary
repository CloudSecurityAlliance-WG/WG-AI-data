Message:  # Summary

The CWE-481 weakness describes cases where code accidentally uses an assignment operator instead of a comparison operator, typically due to a typo. This causes unexpected behavior, like an if statement always evaluating to true or false. Examples are shown in C, C++, C#, and Java code where = is used instead of ==, resulting in a variable being reassigned rather than compared. This can bypass input validation or alter program logic. The likelihood of exploit is considered low, but the impact can be altering execution logic. Recommendations include avoiding boolean comparisons in Java in favor of letting the boolean value stand for itself, and being careful about parameter passing to avoid unintended side effects.
