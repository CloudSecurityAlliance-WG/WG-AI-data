# Summary

The paper explores vulnerabilities in the machine learning model supply chain, whereby models may be surreptitiously backdoored to cause targeted misclassifications. The authors demonstrate attacks where convolutional neural networks for image classification are maliciously trained to introduce backdoors. These "BadNets" behave normally on most inputs but cause intentional misclassifications when a special trigger image is present. 

The attacks are shown to be effective on MNIST digit recognition as well as a more complex traffic sign classifier. The backdoors can persist even after transfer learning to a new task, degrading performance on the new task by 25% when the trigger is present.

The authors examine the real-world threat posed by downloading pretrained models from online model zoos and using them in transfer learning. They find security practices are currently weak, allowing attackers to easily substitute backdoored models. This highlights the need to secure the machine learning supply chain, applying lessons from traditional software supply chain security.

# Summary bullet points

* Maliciously trained "BadNets" with backdoors can reliably cause targeted misclassifications and degrade performance when a special trigger input is present
* Backdoors are stealthy and BadNets exhibit equivalent performance to honestly trained models on normal validation testing
* Attacks demonstrated on MNIST digit recognition and traffic sign classification tasks  
* Backdoors persist even after transfer learning to a new task, degrading performance on new task
* Online model zoos have weak security practices, allowing backdoored models to enter supply chain
* Highlights need to secure machine learning model supply chain as with traditional software
