Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-785, a common weakness in software systems related to the use of path manipulation functions without providing a sufficiently large output buffer. Specifically, it points out that functions like realpath(), readlink(), PathAppend() and others that normalize paths or filenames often require output buffers of at least MAX_PATH bytes to prevent buffer overflows. However, sometimes developers pass buffers that are too small, which can then lead to overflows and potential exploits.

The key points around this weakness are:

- Path manipulation functions usually need large output buffers to return canonicalized path names safely
- Passing inadequately sized buffers to these functions can result in overflows
- This can allow attackers to modify memory, execute code, or cause denial of service crashes
- Mitigation focuses on always allocating sufficiently large output buffers

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-785 relates to use of path manipulation functions without adequately sized output buffers
* Functions like realpath(), readlink(), PathAppend() require buffers >= MAX_PATH bytes  
* Passing too-small buffers to these can cause overflows 
* Enables attackers to modify memory, execute code, cause crashes
* Mitigations involve always allocating large enough output buffers
