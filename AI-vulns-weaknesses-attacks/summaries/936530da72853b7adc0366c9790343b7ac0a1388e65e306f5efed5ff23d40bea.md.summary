Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-782 weakness describes exposed IOCTLs (I/O control mechanisms) that do not properly enforce access control restrictions. IOCTLs allow userspace processes to communicate with and potentially control kernel drivers and hardware devices. If an IOCTL contains privileged functionality but does not restrict access, attackers may be able invoke that functionality to execute code, cause denial of service, or steal data. The consequences depend on the specific functionality exposed. This weakness is prevalent in C/C++ code and affects Unix and Windows platforms. Potential mitigations on Windows involve properly restricting access to associated devices or device namespaces.  

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-782 refers to exposed IOCTLs without proper access control that could enable attackers to access privileged functionality
* IOCTLs allow userspace processes to control drivers and hardware, so exposed IOCTLs put that control at risk 
* The impact varies based on the functionality exposed, including potential code execution, denial of service, and data theft
* Mainly affects C/C++ code and Unix/Windows platforms that utilize IOCTLs
* On Windows, access should be properly restricted for associated devices/namespaces
