Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content from cwe.mitre.org on CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict:

# Summary

The weakness described is an interpretation conflict that occurs when Product A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, causing A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state. This is often found in intermediary security devices like proxies, firewalls, antivirus software, etc. that monitor, allow, deny or modify traffic based on expectations of client/server behavior. Consequences include unexpected system states and integrity issues. Examples are provided of attackers manipulating non-standard message formats that some systems handle differently, allowing filter bypasses, execution of code, and information disclosure. 

Key aspects highlighted related to information security and AI security:
- Inconsistencies in input handling/parsing can be exploited 
- Intermediary security systems that make decisions based on client/server interactions are vulnerable
- Non-standard data formats may be interpreted differently, enabling attacks
- System integrity and confidentiality can be impacted 

# Summary bullet points

* Weakness involves an interpretation conflict between two products handling inputs/steps differently
* Found in security intermediaries (proxies, firewalls, AV software) relying on client/server expectations 
* Consequences are unexpected states and integrity issues
* Attackers use non-standard message formats parsed differently to bypass filters 
* Examples allow code execution, filter bypasses, info disclosure
* Highlights input handling and parsing inconsistencies as security risks
* Intermediary security systems are highlighted as vulnerable
* Non-standard data formats have different interpretations, enabling attacks
* Integrity and confidentiality of systems are at risk
