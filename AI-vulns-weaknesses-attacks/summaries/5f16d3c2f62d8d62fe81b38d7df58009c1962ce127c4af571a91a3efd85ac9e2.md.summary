Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1241 weakness describes the use of predictable algorithms in random number generators. Such pseudo-random number generators are predictable over time and can compromise randomness or expose internal state. This can enable attacks and compromise confidentiality of cryptographic systems relying on secure randomness. Hardware-based true random number generators using physical sources of randomness are recommended instead.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1241 involves using predictable pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithms instead of secure true random number generators (TRNGs)
* PRNGs like linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) have finite state spaces that cause repeating patterns over time
* This predictability compromises randomness and enables attacks like reverse engineering and tampering
* TRNGs utilize hardware-based physical sources of randomness and are cryptographically secure
* TRNGs should be specified in architecture/design and properly implemented for cryptographic functions needing secure randomness
