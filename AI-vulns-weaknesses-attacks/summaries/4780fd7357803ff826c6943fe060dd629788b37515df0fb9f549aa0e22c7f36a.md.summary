# Summary

The document defines CWE-194, a weakness related to unexpected sign extension when converting numeric data types. Specifically, it describes how sign extending a negative number when transforming it into a larger data type can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses. This can cause issues like buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, writing/reading outside intended memory buffers, and values exceeding an application's expected range. Real-world examples demonstrate how CWE-194 can be chained with other weaknesses like integer overflows to cause vulnerabilities.

The mitigation suggests avoiding signed variables when negative values are not needed, validating values after saving to larger types, and validating unsigned function arguments. Mapping information indicates CWE-194 is an acceptable mapping for real-world vulnerabilities at the variant level of abstraction. Relationships show it can lead to other memory and calculation weaknesses.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-194 is a weakness related to unexpected sign extension producing unexpected values 
* Can occur when converting a negative number to a larger data type via sign extension
* Leads to weaknesses like buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, exceeding expected ranges
* Chained CWE-194 can enable integer overflows and other weaknesses  
* Mitigate by avoiding signed variables when possible, validating values in larger types
* Real-world examples demonstrate chaining with other weaknesses
* Mapping info says CWE-194 works for mapping vulnerabilities 
* Related to other memory and calculation weaknesses
