# Summary

The content describes the weakness CWE-170: Improper Null Termination. This weakness occurs when a product does not properly terminate a string or array with a null character. This can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds memory access, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution. Common consequences include crashing, memory corruption, information disclosure, and exploitation of buffer overflow conditions to execute arbitrary code.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-170 involves not properly terminating strings or arrays with a null character
* Can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, denial of service, memory corruption, information disclosure
* Consequences include crashes, memory corruption, info disclosure, exploiting buffer overflows to run arbitrary code
* Can result from off-by-one errors, incorrectly using functions like strncpy() that don't auto-append nulls
* Potential mitigations include using safe string functions, validating null termination, filling buffers with nulls
