Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of performing the same operation on a resource multiple times when it should only be done once (CWE-675). This can lead to various vulnerabilities and issues, such as double freeing memory, binding multiple sockets to the same port, or unlocking a mutex multiple times. Some key aspects highlighted include:

- Performing an operation like freeing memory or binding a socket multiple times usually indicates a flaw in the program logic and flow. It often happens due to error handling issues or confusion over responsibilities.

- Consequences can include crashing the program, data corruption, information leaks, or opening up vectors for attackers to exploit. For example, double unlocking a mutex could enable race conditions.

- It typically represents a violation of the intended API contract and proper usage of functions that operate on resources.

- There are various types of "doubling" issues that can occur beyond just freeing memory twice, including duplicate keys, duplicate validation routines, etc.

# Summary bullet points

* Performing the same operation multiple times on a resource when it should only happen once, such as freeing memory twice
* Often arises from flaws in error handling logic or confusion about responsibilities
* Can cause crashes, data corruption, information leaks, or openings for attackers
* Examples include double freeing memory, binding multiple sockets to one port, unlocking mutexes multiple times
* Usually represents a violation of API contracts and proper usage of functions operating on resources  
* Related to other "doubling" problems like duplicate keys or duplicate validation
