Message:  # Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-6 in the Common Weakness Enumeration system, which is related to the insufficient length of session IDs in J2EE applications. The key points are:

- Short session ID lengths increase the risk of session hijacking attacks, where an attacker is able to guess or steal a valid session ID and take over the user's session. The risk decreases exponentially as the session ID length increases. 

- The expected time for an attacker to guess a valid 64-bit session ID is less than 4 minutes under typical assumptions. For a 128-bit session ID, this increases to over 292 years.

- The recommended minimum length for session IDs is 128 bits. Many application servers set this as the default but it should be validated.

So in summary, the document analyzes the weakness of insufficient session ID lengths in J2EE applications and provides background details, potential mitigations, and examples related to improving session management security overall. The key focus is on ensuring session IDs are at least 128 bits in length.

# Summary bullet points

* Insufficient J2EE session ID length increases risk of session hijacking attacks
* Short IDs enable attackers to easily guess or brute-force valid IDs 
* Expected attack time: < 4 mins for 64-bit IDs; > 292 years for 128-bit IDs  
* Recommend 128-bit minimum length for session IDs
* Validate application server session ID config uses >= 128 bits  
* Overall need to improve session management security
