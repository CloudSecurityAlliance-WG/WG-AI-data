Message:  # Summary

This article from MITRE ATLAS discusses the technique of exfiltrating private information via machine learning (ML) model inference APIs. It explains that ML models can leak private details about their training data, allowing adversaries to infer things like training data membership or invert the model. The model itself could also be extracted for intellectual property theft. This raises privacy issues since training data may contain sensitive personal information. The main mitigation strategies are to restrict the number of queries to ML models and control access to them in production environments.
