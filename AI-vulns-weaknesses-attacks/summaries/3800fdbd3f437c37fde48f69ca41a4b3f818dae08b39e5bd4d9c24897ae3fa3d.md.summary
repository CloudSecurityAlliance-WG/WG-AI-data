Message:  Here is a summary of the key information from the text, formatted according to the provided template:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-261, a common weakness enumeration related to weak encoding of passwords. Specifically, it explains that obscuring a password with a trivial encoding like base64 does not adequately protect the password. This can allow attackers to easily determine the encoded password and use it to break into a system. The text provides examples of insecure Java and C# code that base64 encodes passwords loaded from a properties file and registry. It recommends encrypting passwords with 128+ bit keys for better security.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-261 refers to weak encoding of passwords, which does not properly protect them
* Trivial encodings like base64 can be easily reversed to reveal the password
* Example insecure code loads base64 encoded passwords from files/registry 
* Recommends >=128 bit encryption keys to better secure passwords
* Can allow attackers to determine passwords and break into systems
