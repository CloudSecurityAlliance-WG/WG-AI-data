Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1276, a weakness related to the incorrect connection of a hardware IP child block to its parent system. This can happen when integrating IP into a parent design during implementation. If connections between the IP and system are wrong, it can cause security issues even if there are no functional problems. An example is improperly connecting the privilege or security level signal of an IP to ground rather than the proper signal, allowing privilege escalation of data. The document gives Verilog examples of incorrect and correct connection of privilege and interrupt signals between modules. It suggests testing system-level interactions between blocks to catch connection issues. Overall, improper connections between hardware IP blocks and parent systems during integration can open security vulnerabilities even without functional problems.
