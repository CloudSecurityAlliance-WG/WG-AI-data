# Summary

The paper explains vulnerabilities of deep learning malware detection models to adversarial malware binaries. It focuses on a convolutional neural network called MalConv that detects malware in Windows PE files. Though MalConv reports good accuracy, it is easily fooled by carefully adding padding bytes to malware files. 

The paper uses an explainable AI technique called integrated gradients to identify the most influential input features contributing to MalConv's decisions. The analysis finds that MalConv learns to discriminate between malware and benign files mostly based on characteristics in the PE header, not the sections where malicious code typically hides.  

Based on this finding, the paper proposes a more efficient attack that generates adversarial malware binaries by only modifying a few tens of bytes in the file header. This attack evades MalConv in most cases without needing to inject padding bytes like previous attacks.

# Summary bullet points

* MalConv is a deep learning model for detecting malware in Windows PE files
* MalConv is easily fooled by adding padding bytes to malware, questioning its suitability
* Integrated gradients used to identify most influential input features for MalConv's decisions 
* Finds MalConv bases decisions on PE header, not sections with malicious code
* Proposes attack that evades MalConv by only changing bytes in PE header
* Attack successful in vast majority of cases without padding bytes
