# Summary

The document describes CWE-791, a weakness related to incomplete filtering of special elements in software. It involves a product receiving data from an upstream component but failing to completely filter out special elements like "../" before sending the data downstream. This can enable attacks like relative path traversal (CWE-23) by allowing attackers to craft inputs with malicious special elements that get through the filter. An example is provided of a Perl script that uses a regular expression to filter "../" from user input, but fails to use the global flag so only the first instance gets removed. This allows specially crafted inputs with multiple "../" to traverse up the directory structure when concatenated to a file path.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-791 relates to incomplete filtering of special elements like "../" in software
* Involves data flowing from upstream components to downstream without full filtering
* Can enable attacks like relative path traversal (CWE-23) 
* Example shows Perl script filtering "../" but only first instance without global flag
* Allows specially crafted inputs with multiple "../" to traverse directories when used in file paths
