# Summary

The content describes CWE-1325, an information security weakness related to improperly controlled sequential memory allocation. It involves managing a group of objects or resources by performing separate memory allocations for each one without properly limiting the total memory consumption. This can allow an attacker to cause excessive memory allocation through multiple requests, leading to denial of service through resource exhaustion. The weakness can occur in various languages like C, C++, and others. Potential mitigations include tracking allocations across requests and handling limits appropriately. It can also help set configurable memory limits. Related attack patterns include excessive allocation attacks aiming to consume available memory or other resources.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1325 involves improperly controlled sequential memory allocation without limits
* Permits separate memory allocations for multiple objects or resources 
* Attacker can trigger excessive total memory consumption through multiple requests
* Can cause denial of service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion 
* Mitigations include tracking/limiting allocations, handling limits, configurable memory limits
* Related attack pattern: excessive allocation to consume available memory
