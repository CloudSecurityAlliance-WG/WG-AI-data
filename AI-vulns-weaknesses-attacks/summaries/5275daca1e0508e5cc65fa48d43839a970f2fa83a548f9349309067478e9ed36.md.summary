# Summary

The article discusses CWE-413, which is a weakness related to improper resource locking in software. It occurs when a product does not properly lock a resource when it needs exclusive access. This can lead to race conditions where an attacker modifies the resource while the product is using it, violating assumptions and causing unexpected behavior. Proper locking with synchronization and error handling is needed to avoid issues. 

Examples in C and Java demonstrate both vulnerable and secure code for locking shared resources like mutexes, shared memory, and object data. The key vulnerabilities occur when failing to check return values from lock functions or failing to use any locking at all on shared data. Proper locking mechanisms like mutexes, synchronized blocks, reentrant locks, and lock objects are shown to avoid race conditions.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-413 is improper resource locking, failing to lock shared resources when exclusive access is needed
* Can lead to race conditions and unexpected behaviors 
* Must properly check return values from lock functions
* Must use synchronization, reentrant locks, etc to avoid simultaneous access
* Examples in C using mutexes and pthreads
* Examples in Java using synchronized methods, reentrant locks, lock objects 
* Failing to lock allows integrity and availability issues
