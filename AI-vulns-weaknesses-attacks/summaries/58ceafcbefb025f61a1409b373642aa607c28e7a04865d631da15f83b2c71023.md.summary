Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is the summary and analysis:

# Summary

This CWE entry describes a weakness where a developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into software, but an optimizing compiler removes or modifies the mechanism during compilation. This could allow attackers to bypass the protection and exploit the system. An example shows code that scrubs a password buffer to prevent recovery from memory, but the compiler optimizes away the scrubbing call since the buffer is not used afterwards. 

The problem arises because compilers and languages often optimize for efficiency without considering security implications. Attackers could then access memory and recover the secret data to further exploit the system.

# Summary bullet points

* Developers add security mechanisms but compilers optimize them away 
* Example shows compiler removing scrubbing of password buffer
* Compilers optimize for efficiency over security
* Attackers can access memory to recover removed security measures
* Once they get secret data attackers can further exploit system
