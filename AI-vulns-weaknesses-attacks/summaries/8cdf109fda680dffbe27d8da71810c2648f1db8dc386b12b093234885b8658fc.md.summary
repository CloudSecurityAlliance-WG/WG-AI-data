Message:  # Summary

Inherited permissions refer to the permissions that an object inherits when it is copied or derived from another object. Insecure inherited permissions occur when an object inherits a set of insecure permissions from its parent without user awareness. This can lead to confidentiality and integrity issues, as sensitive data may be inappropriately accessed or modified due to the insecure permissions. Specifically, CWE-278 describes a weakness where a product copies or derives information from an archive file but preserves the insecure permissions of that archive. This could enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

To mitigate this, permissions and privileges should be carefully managed, with trust zones and separation of privilege implemented. Following the principle of least privilege can also help ensure that privileges are only used when absolutely necessary. Explicitly managing trust boundaries in software is also recommended.
