Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of always-incorrect control flow implementation in code. This refers to when a control flow path in the code does not accurately reflect the intended algorithm, leading to incorrect behavior when that path executes. Some examples provided include omitting braces in C code blocks, leading to unintended execution of statements, and omitting break statements in switch blocks in languages like Java and C, causing unintended fall-through to subsequent case blocks. The consequences relate to altered execution logic, enabling things like denial of service attacks or access to unintended code segments.

# Summary bullet points

* Always-incorrect control flow implementation refers to when a control flow path in code does not match the intended algorithm
* Examples include omitting braces in C code blocks, leading to unintended statement execution
* Also includes omitting break statements in switch blocks in Java/C, enabling unintended fall-through
* Can enable consequences like denial of service attacks or access to unintended code
* Overall allows incorrect control flow and unintended execution logic
