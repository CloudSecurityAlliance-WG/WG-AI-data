# Summary

The document describes CWE-172, an encoding error weakness that occurs when a product does not properly encode or decode data, resulting in unexpected values. This can allow attackers to bypass validation checks or insert malicious code. Some common consequences are unexpected application states and impacts to data integrity. Examples of this weakness include forum software improperly decoding URLs, bypassing XSS protection via double encoded slashes, and exposing source code via Unicode encoding. Mitigations focus on proper input validation, output encoding, and ensuring inputs are decoded and canonicalized before validation. The content describes relationships to other weaknesses like path traversal and equivalence issues. It also maps to various attack patterns involving encoding techniques to bypass application logic.
