# Summary

Catching overly broad exceptions in code can obscure exceptions that deserve special handling and prevent the compiler from pointing out new situations where exceptions should be handled differently. This hides activities in the code and alters execution logic in ways that could introduce security vulnerabilities. The example shows catching Exception which would also catch runtime exceptions like ClassCastException that the programmer did not intend to catch there. Automated static analysis tools can detect some instances of this weakness by analyzing control and data flow. The content describes this as a common coding weakness that is a security vulnerability and explains the potential impacts.
