Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-231 weakness describes a situation where a product does not properly handle receiving more input values than expected. This can lead to unexpected application states and vulnerabilities. The key aspects are:

- Products should have input validation to check for unexpected extra input values
- Receiving unexpected extra input can lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows if the extra data overflows buffers
- This is due to products expecting a certain number of input values and not properly handling cases with more values

The weakness highlights the need for secure input validation and checking in products to prevent vulnerabilities from unexpected inputs.

# Summary bullet points

* Can lead to unexpected application states and vulnerabilities like buffer overflows
* Occurs when a product expects a certain number of input values but does not check for or handle extra values
* Extra data can overflow buffers if not properly checked
* Secure input validation needed to prevent this weakness
