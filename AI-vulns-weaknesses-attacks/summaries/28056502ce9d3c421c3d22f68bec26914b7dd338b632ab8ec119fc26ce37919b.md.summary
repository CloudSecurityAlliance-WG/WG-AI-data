Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-383, a weakness related to the direct use of threads in J2EE web applications. It explains that thread management is forbidden by the J2EE standard in some cases and can lead to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and other bugs that are hard to diagnose. The direct creation and management of threads should be avoided in J2EE applications.

# Summary bullet points

* Thread management in J2EE web apps is forbidden in some cases and always error-prone
