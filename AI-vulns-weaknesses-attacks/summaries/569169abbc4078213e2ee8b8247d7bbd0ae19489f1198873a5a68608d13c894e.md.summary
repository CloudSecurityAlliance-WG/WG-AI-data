# Summary

The text describes CWE-405, a common weakness related to asymmetric resource consumption or amplification attacks. These attacks involve an adversary causing a system or product to consume excessive resources disproportionate to the work required by the attacker. This can lead to denial of service through resource exhaustion. Key aspects include:

- Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to amplify resource consumption in a non-linear fashion, consuming more resources than permitted by their access level. This impacts availability through resource exhaustion.

- Specific weaknesses include insufficient control of network traffic volume, inefficient algorithm complexity, improper handling of compressed data, excessive file access operations, and more.

- Consequences include denial of service through CPU, memory, or other resource consumption. Attack effectiveness can be worsened by allowing large inputs.

- Mitigations involve tracking resource allocation, metering usage appropriately, and disabling resource-intensive algorithms if possible. Systems should restrict resource access commensurate with a user's access level.

# Summary bullet points

* Amplification attacks exploit asymmetric resource consumption, exhausting disproportionate resources for the work required
* Leads to denial of service (DOS) through CPU, memory, or other resource exhaustion 
* Weaknesses include no control of network volume, inefficient algorithms, excessive file access
* Consequences include technical impact of DOS and resource consumption
* Mitigations involve tracking resources, metering usage, disabling intensive algorithms
