Message:  # Summary

The text describes the technique "Acquire Public ML Artifacts: Models" from the MITRE ATT&CK framework for adversarial machine learning. It explains that adversaries may acquire public machine learning models, including model architectures and pre-trained models, to use in their operations against a victim organization. These models can be acquired from public sources and searched for using common model file formats. Acquired models are useful for tailoring attacks to the victim's models. The text provides 4 case studies demonstrating how public models have been acquired and used maliciously. It also suggests a mitigation of limiting public release of model artifacts to protect against this technique.
