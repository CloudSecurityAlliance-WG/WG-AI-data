Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes a web application weakness where user-controlled input is not properly filtered for executable scripts disguised by doubling script command characters. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users. It is a variant of the broader cross-site scripting weakness (CWE-79).

The key impacts are that attackers can read sensitive application data and execute unauthorized commands. Examples of actual exploits using doubled characters are given. Mitigations focus on properly validating/filtering all user input, encoding output data appropriately, setting security headers like HttpOnly cookies, and reducing the attack surface exposed.
