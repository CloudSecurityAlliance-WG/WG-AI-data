Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of missing a standardized error handling mechanism across code. Not having a consistent way of handling different types of errors can lead to inconsistent behavior, loss of error context, and unintended information disclosure to users. It can negatively impact code quality, state, and security. The recommended mitigations are to define an error handling strategy for different error severities and use language features or libraries to provide easy and consistent error handling APIs.

# Summary bullet points

* Not having standardized error handling can lead to inconsistent behavior when errors occur
* Error causes may get lost without standardized handling, making debugging difficult
* Sensitive error context may be exposed to users unintentionally 
* Quality, state, and security can be degraded
* Recommend defining error handling strategy for different error severities
* Use language features or libraries to provide consistent error handling APIs
