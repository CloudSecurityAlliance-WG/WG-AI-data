Message:  # Summary

The CWE-1188 weakness describes the initialization or setting of a resource with a default value that is intended to be changed by an administrator, but the default value itself is not secure. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the administrator does not change the insecure default value. The extended description explains that developers often choose convenient default values to make products easy to use out-of-the-box, assuming administrators will change defaults if needed. However, if the default is insecure and not changed, this can leave the product vulnerable. Examples are provided of insecure default variable initialization in code that could allow unauthorized access if exploited.
