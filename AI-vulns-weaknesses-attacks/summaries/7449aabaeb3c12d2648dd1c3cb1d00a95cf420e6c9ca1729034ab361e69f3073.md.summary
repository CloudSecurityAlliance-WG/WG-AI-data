Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-188 describes the weakness of reliance on data/memory layout in software. It occurs when a product makes invalid assumptions about how protocol data or memory is organized at a lower level, resulting in unintended program behavior. 

Examples include assuming the layout of local variables in memory, calculating memory addresses incorrectly by deriving them based on other addresses, or improperly handling changes in protocol data layout across versions. Consequences can include unintended modification of memory, exposure of sensitive memory, crashes, or logical errors.

Mitigations focus on fully specifying protocol grammar and data structures, validating protocol parsing, testing edge cases from new versions, and avoiding memory address arithmetic that assumes specific layouts.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-188 refers to improper assumptions about memory or protocol data layouts
* Can occur from invalid offset calculations, wrong variable ordering assumptions, unclear specifications
* Leads to memory corruption, information exposure, crashes
* Mitigations include clear specifications, address validity testing, version testing
