# Summary

The content describes the weakness CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime. This refers to when a product fails to release a resource after it is no longer needed, allowing attackers to cause denial of service by allocating resources without releasing them. Common resources that can be affected include memory, CPU, disk space, etc. Failure to release resources can allow an attacker to deplete the available resources, preventing other processes from accessing them. Proper error handling and cleanup of resources is important to avoid this weakness. 

The content provides examples of vulnerable code in various languages that fail to properly release resources like file handles or database connections. It explains how missing releases can allow exhaustion of available resources over time. Potential mitigations are provided, like using languages with automatic garbage collection, setting resource limits, and ensuring proper error handling to release resources.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-772 refers to failure to release a resource after it is no longer needed, allowing denial of service through resource exhaustion attacks
* Affected resources may include memory, CPU, disk space, file handles, network connections
* Failure to close files, network connections, etc can gradually deplete available resources 
* Proper error handling and cleanup is important to avoid missing releases
* Potential mitigations include garbage collected languages, resource limitation settings, ensuring releases occur at all exit points
