Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is a summary of the key information from the CWE data focusing on information security and AI security related aspects:

# Summary

The CWE weakness describes the storage of critical security state data about users or the system itself in a location accessible to attackers. If attackers can modify this data without detection, it could enable unauthorized actions, access, or privilege escalation since the application does not expect the state to change. 

Examples of vulnerable state data include cookies, hidden web fields, parameters/arguments, environment variables, database records, settings files. When used to control security or resource usage, external control of such data can lead to bypass of access controls, unauthorized reading of sensitive data, denial of service through unexpected errors, and privilege escalation.

Mitigations focus on storing state only on the server side, tracking state transitions, duplicating checks on server side, using cryptographic protections for data integrity, attack surface reduction, and environment hardening. Identification methods include static analysis, fuzz testing, manual reviews.

# Summary bullet points

* Storage of critical security state data about users/system in locations accessible to attackers enables attacks if modified
* Examples include cookies, web fields, parameters, environment variables, database records, settings files
* Consequences include bypass of access controls, unauthorized data access, denial of service, privilege escalation 
* Mitigations include server-side only storage, state tracking, duplicated checks, cryptography, attack surface reduction
* Identification via static analysis, fuzzing, manual reviews
