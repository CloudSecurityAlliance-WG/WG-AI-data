Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The text summarizes CWE-5, a common weakness enumeration related to J2EE misconfiguration leading to data transmission without encryption. It describes how information sent unencrypted over a network can be compromised, allowing an attacker to read or modify data. This is a child of CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. It mainly affects confidentiality and integrity. Mitigations involve using SSL or strong encryption for all access-controlled pages. The text mentions it is easy for SSL to be bypassed if URLs are manually typed without HTTPS, attackers send users to HTTP pages, or links between pages don't switch protocols. It also maps this weakness to the "J2EE Misconfiguration: Insecure Transport" node in the Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy.
