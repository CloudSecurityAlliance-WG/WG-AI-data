Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes a potential software weakness where a serializable data element contains non-serializable member elements. This can reduce reliability by preventing the product from running properly. If reachable by an attacker, it could introduce a vulnerability. Examples are serializable attributes in .NET and inheritance of java.io.Serializable in Java. It is considered an indirect weakness that makes it easier to introduce security issues or makes them harder to detect.
