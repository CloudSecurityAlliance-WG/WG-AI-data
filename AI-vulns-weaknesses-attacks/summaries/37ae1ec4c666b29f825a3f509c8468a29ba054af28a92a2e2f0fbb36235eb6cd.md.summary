# Summary

The paper explores the vulnerability of neural network image classifiers to spatial transformations like small rotations and translations. It finds that state-of-the-art models have high accuracy on clean images but suffer significant performance degradation from random spatial perturbations, suggesting brittleness. 

Investigating different attack methods shows that a grid search adversary can find misclassifications for over 70% of correctly classified natural images on MNIST and CIFAR10. First-order attacks fail to approximate this due to the non-concavity of the loss landscape. This makes spatial robustness fundamentally different from Lp norm robustness.

Data augmentation with random rotations and translations during training improves robustness on MNIST and CIFAR10 but has marginal impact on Imagenet. Additional proposed defense methods of robust optimization using worst-of-k training and aggregating predictions over random transformations at test time are more effective, improving worst-case accuracy on Imagenet from 31% to 56%.

The spatial and Lp norm perturbation settings are shown to be largely orthogonal. This highlights the need to consider more general notions of similarity than just pixel-wise distances in defining adversarial images.
