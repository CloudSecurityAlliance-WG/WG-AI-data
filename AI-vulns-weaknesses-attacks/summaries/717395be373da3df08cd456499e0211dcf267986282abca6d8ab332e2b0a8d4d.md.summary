Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of having an excessive volume of commented-out code within an invokable control element like a function or method. This makes the code harder to maintain and indirectly affects security by making it more difficult to find and fix vulnerabilities. It recommends a 2% threshold for commented out code. The issue impacts maintainability and quality.

# Summary bullet points

* Having excessive commented-out code (recommended threshold 2% of lines) in functions/methods reduces maintainability 
* Harder to maintain code indirectly impacts security by making vulnerabilities harder to find and fix
* Mostly a quality issue rather than direct security risk
* Listed as "prohibited" for mapping real-world vulnerabilities
