# Summary

The article describes the weakness CWE-193: Off-by-one Error. This is a weakness where a product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more or 1 less than the correct value. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, infinite loops, data corruption, buffer overflows, and arbitrary code execution. Examples are provided of off-by-one errors in C code that can cause out-of-bounds writes and buffer overflows. The key points are that off-by-one errors happen when there is an error in calculating buffer sizes or loop bounds, which can then lead to serious vulnerabilities if memory safety is compromised. Care needs to be taken to properly account for elements like null terminators and ensure sufficient memory is allocated.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-193 is an off-by-one error where a max/min value is incorrectly calculated as 1 more or less than intended
* Can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, infinite loops, data corruption, buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution
* Happens when there are errors calculating buffer sizes or loop iteration bounds
* Examples in C code with incorrect buffer size allocation and incorrect loop termination
* Failure to account for null terminator when concatenating strings with strncat()
* Can result in out-of-bounds writes and buffer overflows if memory safety is compromised
