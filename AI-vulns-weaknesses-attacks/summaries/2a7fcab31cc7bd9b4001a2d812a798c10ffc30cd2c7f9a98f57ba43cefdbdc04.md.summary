Message:  # Summary

The text appears to be from a website called PLOT4ai, which is a library containing threats related to AI and ML systems. It classifies the threats into 8 different categories. The site encourages users to familiarize themselves with the capabilities of AI systems they interact with, as lacking awareness poses risks. Users should be informed what to expect from AI systems, not just for transparency but also safety reasons in some products. 

The site seems to frame the awareness issue as a question to the user - can they anticipate the system's actions and are they aware of its capabilities. If the answer is no, then the user is deemed at risk. The content suggests users' lack of understanding of what an AI system can and cannot do makes them vulnerable to potential harms. This speaks to the larger issue of AI/ML transparency and interpretability.

Overall the text revolves around risks from users not comprehending AI system behaviors and abilities. It advocates resolving this by proactively informing users of expected functionality to mitigate dangers. This need for user awareness ties directly to information security around AI, as vulnerable populations can better protect themselves with knowledge of system capacities.
