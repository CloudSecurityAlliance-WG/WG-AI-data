# Summary

The document describes CWE-1332, a weakness related to the improper handling of faults that can lead to the skipping of security-critical CPU instructions. Specifically, it notes that devices may be missing or incorrectly implement circuitry to detect and mitigate instruction skipping that can occur due to electrical disturbances or when a device operates outside expected conditions. Attackers can use fault injection techniques to intentionally cause more frequent instruction skipping to bypass security mechanisms. The impact includes bypassing of protection mechanisms and altering execution logic in ways that negatively impact confidentiality, integrity and authentication.  

The document provides details on relationships to other weakness classifications, modes of introduction, applicable platforms, common consequences, demonstrative examples, potential mitigations, detection methods and related information. Key mitigations include redundancy, failure handling strategies, monitoring for anomalies, and resetting/wiping secrets if faults are detected. Overall, it provides comprehensive information related to this hardware-based weakness and its security implications.
