Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1094, a weakness related to excessive index range scans over large data tables. This can reduce performance and make a product slower. The thresholds for considering a data table "large" and an index range "excessive" are 1 million rows and scanning over 10 indices, respectively. While not directly introducing a vulnerability, the performance issues could make the system more vulnerable. The weakness is categorized as an indirect quality issue that could facilitate vulnerabilities or make them harder to detect. It is part of categories related to performance efficiency, resource lifecycle management, and bad coding practices. The weakness should not be used to map real-world vulnerabilities as it is primarily a quality issue with no direct security impact.
