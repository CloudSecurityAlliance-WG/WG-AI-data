Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document discusses CWE-9, a common weakness related to insecure configuration and access control issues in J2EE applications. Specifically, it describes the weakness where elevated access rights are assigned to EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) methods, allowing attackers to exploit the permissions and compromise the system. 

The key points are:

- Granting the special ANYONE role access to EJB methods indicates poor access control planning or limitations that prevent reasonable restrictions.

- This misconfiguration enables attackers to invoke methods like getSalary() and access sensitive data they should not have access to. 

- It violates the principle of least privilege and enables broken access control attacks ranked in the OWASP Top 10.

- The weakness allows unauthorized information disclosure and expanded access beyond intended permissions.

- Mitigations focus on following least privilege principles for access control and not granting the ANYONE role permissions to EJB methods.

# Summary bullet points

* Grants ANYONE role access to invoke privileged EJB methods
* Violates principle of least privilege and enables broken access control 
* Ranked in OWASP Top 10 and enables unauthorized information disclosure
* Weakness allows attackers to exploit permissions and compromise systems
* Mitigations involve proper access control with least privilege
