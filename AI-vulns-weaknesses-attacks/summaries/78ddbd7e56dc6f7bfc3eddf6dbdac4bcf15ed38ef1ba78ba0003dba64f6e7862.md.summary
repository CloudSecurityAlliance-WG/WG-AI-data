Message:  # Summary

The CWE-837 weakness describes a situation where a product requires a user to only perform a particular action once, but fails to properly enforce this restriction. This could enable attackers to bypass intended usage limits and gain an advantage over other users. For example, in an e-voting system, an attacker could stuff the ballot box by voting multiple times. Or in an e-library, an attacker could check out the same limited e-book multiple times to prevent others from accessing it. The consequences vary by context but generally allow attackers to negatively impact other users or the correctness of the product's operation. Proper enforcement of usage limits is important for security and intended system behavior.
