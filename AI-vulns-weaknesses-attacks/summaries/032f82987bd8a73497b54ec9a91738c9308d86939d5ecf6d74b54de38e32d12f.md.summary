# Summary

The document describes CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code, which refers to product code that is not essential for execution and has no impact on functionality or correctness if removed. Such irrelevant code could include dead code, unused initialization, empty blocks, optimizable code, etc. It is a child of the broader CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards. Irrelevant code can negatively impact reliability and performance. Examples are provided such as impossible conditional statements and assigned variables that are overwritten without use. The weakness is considered an indirect weakness that could make it easier to introduce other security issues undetected.
