# Summary

The document describes integer coercion errors which refer to flaws pertaining to the type casting, extension, or truncation of primitive data types. These errors can result in availability issues, data integrity issues, or in some cases, exploitable buffer overflow conditions allowing arbitrary code execution. They often lead to undefined program states like infinite loops or crashes. They also store incorrect values for affected variables. Common consequences include denial of service through resource consumption or crashes, and potential exploits through buffer overflows resulting from very large numbers used in memory operations after coercion from negative to unsigned integers. These issues frequently occur in C, C++, Java, C#, and other languages. Potential mitigations involve choosing languages that throw exceptions on bad casts, simplifying unnecessary casting operations, and validating any required casting thoroughly.
