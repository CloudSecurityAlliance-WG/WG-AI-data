# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry describes a weakness where a product fails to properly implement or use security protections that would sufficiently defend against attacks. This includes missing protections, insufficient protections that don't fully mitigate attacks, and ignored protections that are available but not applied everywhere needed. Without adequate protections, products are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks that can access functionality or data that should be restricted, break encryption or bypass other security checks.

This is a broad, high-level weakness that encompasses many more specific weaknesses related to missing or inadequate authentication, access controls, encryption, input validation, logging and more. The lack of proper protections provides opportunities for attackers to obtain sensitive data, take control of systems, and otherwise compromise security.

As systems grow more complex with wider attack surfaces, ensuring comprehensive protection mechanisms are properly implemented across all components is critical, especially for safety and security critical systems. Hardware and low-level software weaknesses can be particularly problematic by enabling physical tampering, reverse engineering or fault injection attacks.

# Summary bullet points

* Covers missing, insufficient or ignored security protections against intended attacks
* Leads to compromise like unauthorized access, broken encryption, injection attacks
* Encompasses weaknesses in access controls, encryption, input validation etc. 
* High severity - allows wide range of exploits, system compromise
* Applies to complex systems with distributed components and broad attack surface
* Hardware and low-level software weaknesses enable physical tampering/fault attacks
* Critical for safety systems, ICS/OT, complex platforms
