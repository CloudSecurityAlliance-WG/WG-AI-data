Message:  Here is the summary and analysis of the provided text:

# Summary

The text describes CWE-1125: Excessive Attack Surface, a weakness related to products having an excessively large attack surface. An attack surface refers to the number of inputs and outputs that can be used by an attacker to compromise the system. A large attack surface provides more opportunities for attackers and for developers to introduce vulnerabilities. While not a direct security weakness, an excessive attack surface indicates low quality and complexity that could lead to security issues. The text explains that CWE-1125 is designated as an indirect weakness that reflects poor coding practices rather than a direct vulnerability. It is prohibited from being used to map real-world vulnerabilities.
