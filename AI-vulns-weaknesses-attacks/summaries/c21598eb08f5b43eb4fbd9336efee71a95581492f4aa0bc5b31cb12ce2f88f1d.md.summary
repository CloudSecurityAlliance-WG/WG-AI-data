Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes the weakness of relying on machine-dependent data representations in code. Using low-level data constructs that vary across different processors and machines makes code harder to maintain and port across environments. This indirectly reduces security by making it more difficult to find and fix vulnerabilities.
