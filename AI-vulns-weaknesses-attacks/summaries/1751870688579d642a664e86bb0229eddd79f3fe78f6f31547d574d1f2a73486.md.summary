# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration entry CWE-825 describes the weakness of expired pointer dereference, which occurs when a product dereferences a pointer that used to be valid but no longer points to allocated memory. This expired pointer could be caused by memory that was previously freed or reallocated. Dereferencing the expired pointer can lead to crashes, exposure of sensitive information, or arbitrary code execution. Mitigations include using languages with automatic memory management or setting pointers to NULL after freeing the memory.
