Message:  # Summary

The CWE-419 weakness describes a product that uses a primary channel for administration or restricted functionality but does not properly protect that channel. This leaves the channel vulnerable to attackers gaining privileged access or assuming identities via that unprotected channel. The mitigations recommend not exposing administrative functionality through user interfaces, and protecting restricted functions with strong authentication.
