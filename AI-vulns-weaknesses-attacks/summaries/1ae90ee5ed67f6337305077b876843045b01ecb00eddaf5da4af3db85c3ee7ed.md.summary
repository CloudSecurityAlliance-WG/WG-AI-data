Message:  # Summary

This text discusses the technique of obtaining software tools to support adversarial operations against machine learning systems. It states that adversaries may search for and repurpose legitimate software, or modify software, to achieve their malicious goals. While the software tools themselves may not employ machine learning, they can be used to mount attacks. The text specifically calls out one subtechnique for obtaining adversarial machine learning attack implementations. It also mentions a case study involving hijacking a camera feed to fool a facial recognition system. Overall, it focuses on the ways adversaries can develop resources like software tools to carry out attacks on machine learning and AI systems.
