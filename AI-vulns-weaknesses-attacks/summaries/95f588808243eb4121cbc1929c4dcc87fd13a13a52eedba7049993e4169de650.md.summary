# Summary

The paper examines backdoor attacks against Deep Generative Models (DGMs), which enable high-dimensional data sampling and have widespread adoption. While backdoor attacks against discriminative models are well-studied, DGMs lack analysis despite increasing industry usage. The authors formalize a threat model detailing attack objectives, adversary capabilities, and potential damage from compromised DGMs. Three attack strategies are introduced: TrAIL trains a model from scratch with an adversarial loss balancing fidelity and stealth; ReD retrains a pre-trained model through distillation; ReX expands layers of a pre-trained model. Experiments across modalities and models show attacks achieve high fidelity and stealth. Defenses based on model/output inspection are discussed, noting challenges like vanishing gradients and detection probabilities too small for brute-force sampling. Still, a combination of techniques can effectively detect a range of attacks. Practical recommendations highlight risks from third-party models and limitations of common defenses.

# Summary bullet points

* Deep Generative Models (DGMs) enable complex, high-dimensional data sampling but lack security analysis despite growing adoption
* A formal threat model details attack surface, objectives, adversary capabilities and potential damage from backdoors in sourced DGMs  
* Three attack strategies balance conflicting goals of fidelity (producing target outputs on triggers) and stealth (maintaining overall distribution)
* Experiments across models and data types demonstrate high attack fidelity and stealth, even on large models like StyleGAN
* Defenses based on model architecture/parameter inspection and output analysis face challenges but combinations can detect attacks
* Practical recommendations highlight risks of third-party models, attack resilience despite common defenses, and need for scrutiny
