Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-530 weakness describes the exposure of backup files to unauthorized parties. This occurs when backup files are stored in accessible directories or archives. Often these backup files use extensions like .~bk but retain old source code. If retrieved, attackers could gain sensitive information about an application's code, database interactions, or site structure. This exposure enables unauthorized data access and presents a confidentiality threat.
