Message:  # Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-163 describes an vulnerability where a product receives input but does not properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes multiple trailing special elements. These unhandled special elements could then be interpreted in unexpected ways when processed by downstream components, resulting in unexpected application behavior or attacks. 

Key aspects highlighted include:

- Input validation is critical to sanitize incoming data and prevent injection of unanticipated special elements 
- Allowlists should be used to restrict inputs to only what is explicitly allowed
- Output encoding can help quote special characters to prevent unintended interpretation
- Trailing elements like dots, slashes, etc. require careful handling as they may be manipulated to enable attacks if left unchecked

Proper secure coding practices should assume all inputs are malicious and employ defense-in-depth mitigation strategies at input, processing, and output stages.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-163 deals with improper handling of multiple trailing special elements in input
* Can lead to unexpected application behavior or enable attacks when processed downstream 
* Input validation using allowlists important to restrict inputs 
* Output encoding can quote special elements to prevent unintended interpretation
* Dots, slashes, etc require careful handling as they may be manipulated if left unchecked
* Assume all input is malicious and have layered defenses at input, processing, output
