Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

This CWE entry describes a reflection attack vulnerability that can occur in mutual authentication protocols that use the same preshared key for multiple entities. An attacker can impersonate a valid user and trick the server into revealing the secret shared between it and the user. The attacker then uses this secret to authenticate as the valid user. This can allow unauthorized access and privilege escalation. 

Key mitigations include using different keys for the initiator and responder and requiring the initiator to prove its identity before proceeding with authentication.
