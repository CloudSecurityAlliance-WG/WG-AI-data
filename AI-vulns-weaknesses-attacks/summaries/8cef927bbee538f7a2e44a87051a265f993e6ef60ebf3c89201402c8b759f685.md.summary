Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-363, a weakness related to race conditions that enable malicious link following. Specifically, it involves a product that checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it. This check produces a race condition where the file can be replaced with a link before the access occurs, causing the product to access the wrong file. This can allow attackers to trick the product into accessing arbitrary files. 

The document provides an extended description, relationships to other CWE weaknesses, applicable platforms, common consequences, a demonstrative example in PHP, and references. The key points are:

- Race conditions with a small time window between checks and use can allow attackers to access unintended files.

- This weakness enables improper link following (CWE-59) by replacing files with links after status checks occur. 

- It can lead to confidentiality and integrity impacts by allowing attackers to read or modify unintended files.

- Applicable to any language, not just PHP demonstrated.

- Can cause products to access the wrong files.

# Summary bullet points

* Describes a race condition weakness (CWE-363) involving status checks on files/directories before access
* These checks allow the file/directory to be replaced by a link afterwards
* Enables malicious link following (CWE-59) by tricking products into accessing unintended files
* Attacker can increase the race condition time window through slowing the system or many attacks
* Applicable to any language, not just the PHP example
* Can violate confidentiality and integrity by allowing access to unintended files
* Attacker can trick product into accessing the wrong arbitrary files they control
