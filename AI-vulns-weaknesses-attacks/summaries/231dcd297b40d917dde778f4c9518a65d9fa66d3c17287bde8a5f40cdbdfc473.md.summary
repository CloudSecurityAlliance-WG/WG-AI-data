Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-917 weakness describes a vulnerability where user-controlled input is improperly neutralized before being inserted into expression language (EL) statements in frameworks like Java Server Pages (JSP). This allows attackers to inject executable EL expressions that could lead to remote code execution, unauthorized access to data, or other impacts. Mitigations include avoiding using user input in EL statements, validating/encoding any necessary user input, or disabling EL statement processing altogether.
