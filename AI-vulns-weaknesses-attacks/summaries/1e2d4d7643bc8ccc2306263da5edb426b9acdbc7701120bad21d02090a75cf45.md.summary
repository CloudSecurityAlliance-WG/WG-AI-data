# Summary

The document describes CWE-1342, a weakness related to information exposure through microarchitectural state after transient execution in processors. When a processor encounters an exception, mis-speculation, or needs microcode assist, it performs a flush to clear results no longer needed. However, traces may remain in microarchitectural buffers, changing state and potentially exposing sensitive information through side channels. Attacks require: 1) erroneous transient execution leaving sensitive data remnants, 2) ability to provoke exceptions, and 3) exploitable operations/structures in victim code. Mitigations involve ensuring no illegal data flows or traces exist in microarchitectural state, and using instructions to explicitly remove traces before next operation.  

# Summary bullet points

* Weakness related to information exposure through processor microarchitectural state after transient execution 
* Exceptions, mis-speculations, microcode assists should flush unused results but traces may remain
* Changed microarchitectural state can expose sensitive data through side channels
* Attacks require: erroneous transient execution, ability to provoke exceptions, exploitable operations/structures
* Mitigations: ensure no illegal data flows/traces in microarchitectural state, explicitly remove traces
