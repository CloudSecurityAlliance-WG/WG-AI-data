# Summary

The paper investigates whether a target black-box convolutional neural network (CNN) model can be copied by persuading it to "confess" its knowledge using random non-labeled data. The approach has two main steps: 1) Query the target network with random natural images, get predicted labels, and create a fake dataset capturing the target network's knowledge. 2) Train a "copycat" CNN on this fake dataset to mimic the target network's performance. 

Experiments were conducted on facial expression, object, and crosswalk image classification problems. Copycat networks achieved 93.7-99.3% of target network performance using non-problem domain images, and 98.6-100.8% with additional problem domain images. An attack on the Microsoft Azure Emotion API reached 97.3% of its performance.

The results demonstrate that CNNs do not need in-domain training data to operate in a problem area. With enough random natural images and labels from the target network, a copycat can reach near equivalent performance. This represents a significant vulnerability for companies providing CNN models commercially.
