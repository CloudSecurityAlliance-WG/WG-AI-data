# Summary

The weakness described is a permission race condition that can occur when copying or cloning a resource. The product does not properly set permissions or access controls on the resource until after the copy operation completes. This leaves the resource exposed to unauthorized access while the copying is still in progress. Common examples occur in file archive extraction or copying deeply nested directories. The larger the archive or more nested directories, the larger the timing window for the race condition exploit. This can lead to unauthorized parties reading or modifying data they should not have access to.
