# Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. This refers to the vulnerability that arises when a product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid. Deserialized data or code can often be modified without using provided accessor functions if cryptography is not used to protect it. Data from untrusted sources cannot be trusted to be well-formed. If gadget chains are allowed during deserialization, attackers may be able to perform unauthorized actions like command execution.

The consequences of this weakness can vary widely depending on which objects or methods are deserialized and how they are used. Making assumptions about the validity of deserialized code is dangerous and can enable exploitation. 

Mitigations focus on using cryptography to protect deserialized data, validating deserialized data before use, making fields transient to avoid deserialization, restricting gadgets and types available during deserialization, and explicitly preventing deserialization in sensitive code.

# Summary bullet points

* Deserialization of untrusted data is dangerous because deserialized data/code can be arbitrarily modified
* Gadget chains during deserialization can allow unauthorized code execution or actions
* Consequences depend on what gets deserialized and how it's used afterwards 
* Use cryptography to protect serialized data integrity 
* Validate deserialized data before use
* Make sensitive fields transient to avoid deserialization 
* Restrict gadgets and types available during deserialization
* Explicitly prevent or restrict deserialization in sensitive code
