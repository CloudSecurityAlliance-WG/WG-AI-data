# Summary

The content describes the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) weakness (CWE-352). CSRF is a vulnerability where a web application does not properly verify that a request was intentionally sent by the user who submitted it. This allows an attacker to trick a user into making unintentional requests that will be treated as authentic by the application. Consequences of CSRF exploits may allow the attacker to gain privileges, bypass protections, read/modify data, or cause denial of service. There are various potential mitigations listed, including: validating session data, generating unique nonces, requiring confirmation before dangerous operations, and checking the HTTP referer header. The content provides examples of CSRF attacks, as well as references for further information.
