Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-455 weakness describes a situation where a product does not exit or modify its operation when errors occur during initialization, such as configuration file errors or hardware security module activation failures. This can leave the product in an insecure state, allowing attackers to modify sensitive data or execute unintended logic. 

Potential consequences include compromised integrity if the application is left in an insecure state, enabling attackers to alter execution logic or modify sensitive data.

Examples are provided, including a Perl code snippet that intends to restrict certain operations to administrators. If a database timeout occurs and state data is not explicitly set, a user could inadvertently be assigned admin privileges. 

Mitigations focus on failing securely when errors occur to avoid vulnerable states, not displaying sensitive error messages to attackers.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-455 involves products not exiting/modifying operation when security-relevant initialization errors occur
* Can leave product in insecure state, allowing unintended access or logic execution
* Consequences include compromised integrity - attackers could alter logic or data
* Example shows user getting admin access due to missing state data from a database timeout  
* Mitigations include failing securely on errors and avoiding displaying sensitive error messages
