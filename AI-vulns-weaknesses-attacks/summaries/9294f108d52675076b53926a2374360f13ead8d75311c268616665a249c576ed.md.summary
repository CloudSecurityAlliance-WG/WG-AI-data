# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-343 describes a weakness where a product's random number generator produces a predictable series of values that allows an attacker to infer a small range of possibilities for the next value. This reduces the effort for brute force attacks. For example, if the generator produces values between 1-100 but always increases, an 80 would mean the next value is between 81-100, reducing the possibilities from 100 to 20. 

The main consequences are that it enables brute force attacks by reducing the range of possibilities that need to be tried. It impacts confidentiality and integrity.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-343 involves predictable random number ranges that allow attackers to infer the next possible values
* This enables brute force attacks by significantly reducing the range of values an attacker needs to try
* It reduces the entropy and unpredictability that is essential for secure random number generation
* Main consequences are enabling brute force attacks and impacts to confidentiality and integrity
