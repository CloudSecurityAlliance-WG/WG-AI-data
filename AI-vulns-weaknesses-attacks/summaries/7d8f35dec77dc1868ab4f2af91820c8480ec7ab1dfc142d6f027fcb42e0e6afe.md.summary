Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-160 weakness describes improper neutralization of leading special elements in input data that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when sent to downstream components. This can lead to unexpected application behavior and potential attacks if malicious input is able to exploit it. The key points are:

- Leading special characters like '/', '.' etc in input data are not properly handled 
- This can cause downstream components to misinterpret the input and take unintended actions
- It can enable path traversal and other attacks by attackers providing crafted input
- Proper input validation, escaping, encoding and canonicalization is needed to neutralize such inputs
- Both denylists and allowlists should be used to validate input

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-160 focuses on improper handling of leading special characters in input
* Can cause downstream components to misinterpret input and take unintended actions
* Enables path traversal and other attacks using malicious input
* Need input validation, escaping, encoding to neutralize such inputs  
* Use denylists and allowlists to validate input
