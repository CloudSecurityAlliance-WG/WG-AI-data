# Summary

The document describes CWE-386, a common weakness enumeration related to symbolic names not mapping to the correct object. It occurs when a constant symbolic reference to an object is used, but the reference can resolve to a different object over time. This can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access, modify data, files or directories, read sensitive information, hide activities, and more. The weakness is applicable across multiple languages and platforms. It is child of CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference and a peer of other concurrency and reference issues. The document provides details on consequence scopes, technical impacts, relationships to other weaknesses, taxonomy mappings, submission history, and notes on usage and rationale.
