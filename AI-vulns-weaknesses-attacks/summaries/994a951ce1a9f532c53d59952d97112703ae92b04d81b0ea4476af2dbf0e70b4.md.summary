Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE-394 weakness describes when a product does not properly check when a function or operation returns a value that is legitimate for the function, but not expected by the product. This can lead to unexpected behavior or states that alter execution logic in ways that lead to vulnerabilities. 

Key impacts include compromised integrity via unexpected states or altered execution logic. It is applicable across languages and often results from improper error handling or unchecked status conditions. Examples demonstrate vulnerabilities enabling denial of service, infinite loops, information disclosure through uninitialized memory, and bypassing of access restrictions.
