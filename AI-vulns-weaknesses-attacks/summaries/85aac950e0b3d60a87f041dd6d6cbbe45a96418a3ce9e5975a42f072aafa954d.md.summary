Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The weakness described is the improper release of memory resources, specifically calling the wrong release function or calling the right function incorrectly. This can take several forms:

- Allocating memory with one method but releasing it with an incompatible method
- Choosing the right memory management functions but using them incorrectly
- Attempting to return a memory resource to the system but calling the wrong release function or calling the appropriate release function incorrectly

This weakness can result in corruption of memory and instructions, possibly leading to crashes, modification of memory, denial of service, or execution of unauthorized code if the corrupted memory is controlled effectively. 

Examples are provided of attempts to free memory allocated with one method using a different, incompatible method, attempts to free memory in the middle of the allocated buffer instead of the beginning, and attempts to individually free parts of memory that were allocated together in one chunk.

# Summary bullet points

* Attempting to return memory resource to system but calling wrong release function or calling correct function incorrectly
* Can allocate with one method, deallocate with incompatible method 
* May choose right functions but use incorrectly
* Can result in memory corruption, crashes, denial of service, code execution
* Examples: 
    * Freeing memory allocated with one method using incompatible method
    * Freeing memory in middle of buffer instead of beginning
    * Attempting to free individual parts of memory allocated together
