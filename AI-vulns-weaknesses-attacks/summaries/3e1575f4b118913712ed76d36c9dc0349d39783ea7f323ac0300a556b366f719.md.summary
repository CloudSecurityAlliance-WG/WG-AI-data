# Summary

The content describes the CWE-431 software weakness related to missing exception handlers in code. When an exception is thrown and not caught by an exception handler, it misses the opportunity to handle failures or events that could lead to unexpected behavior. This could reveal sensitive debugging information to attackers that helps them exploit the system. It emphasizes the need to implement handlers for any operation that can throw exceptions.
