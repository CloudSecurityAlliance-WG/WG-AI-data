# Summary

The document describes the CWE-401 weakness regarding missing release of memory after its effective lifetime, which causes memory leaks. It explains that memory leaks happen when allocated memory is not properly tracked and released after use. This is often caused by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. Memory leaks reduce system reliability and performance and could allow denial-of-service attacks if intentionally triggered. The document provides examples of memory leaks in C code and past vulnerabilities. It suggests various mitigations like using languages with automatic memory management, tools to detect leaks, and abstraction libraries. Key concepts covered include tracking allocated memory, properly releasing memory no longer needed, causes of memory leaks, and mitigation techniques.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-401 involves not properly tracking and releasing allocated memory after use, causing memory leaks 
* Memory leaks hurt reliability, performance, and could enable denial-of-service attacks
* Causes include malformed data and interrupted sessions confusing responsibility for freeing memory
* Mitigations include automatic memory management, leak detection tools, and abstraction libraries
* Proper tracking of allocated memory and release when no longer needed is critical
* Languages like C require manual memory management and are prone to these weaknesses
* Leaks result from confusion on which part of code should free the memory
