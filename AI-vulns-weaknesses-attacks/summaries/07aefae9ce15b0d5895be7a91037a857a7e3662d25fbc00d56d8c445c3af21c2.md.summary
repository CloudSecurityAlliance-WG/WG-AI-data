Message:  # Summary

The article discusses LLM prompt injection, which is a technique adversaries can use to cause language models to act in unintended and potentially harmful ways. Prompt injections are crafted inputs that can bypass defenses or allow privileged commands. They can provide an initial foothold for further malicious activity. Prompt injections may be inserted directly by an attacker to generate harmful content or gain system access. They can also be inserted indirectly when the model ingests malicious prompts from another data source, providing backdoor access or targeting users. Prompt injection poses information security and AI security risks as it can be used to subvert expected model behavior.
