Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-26, a weakness related to path traversal vulnerabilities. Specifically, it covers how software can be vulnerable if it uses external input to construct pathnames without properly neutralizing "/dir/../filename" sequences. This allows attackers to traverse outside intended directories and access unauthorized files and directories. Mitigations focus on input validation strategies such as allowlists to restrict inputs to expected values.  

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-26 refers to path traversal vulnerabilities from unneutralized "/dir/../filename" input sequences 
* Allows accessing files/directories outside intended restricted directories
* Useful for attackers bypassing some path traversal protections 
* Applicable for web servers and other languages
* Leads to unauthorized access to read/modify files  
* Mitigations include stringent input validation and allowlists for inputs like filenames
