Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-1064, a weakness related to having an invokable control element such as a function or method that has an excessive number of parameters. This makes the code more difficult to understand and maintain, indirectly reducing security. CISQ recommends a maximum of 7 parameters.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1064 is a weakness where an invokable control element like a function has too many parameters, making the code harder to maintain
* This indirectly impacts security by making it more difficult to find and fix vulnerabilities
* CISQ recommends a default maximum of 7 parameters per function
* It is considered primarily a quality issue rather than a direct security risk
* Mapped as prohibited for use in vulnerability mapping
