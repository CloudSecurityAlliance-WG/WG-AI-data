# Summary

The document describes the weakness CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection'). This refers to a vulnerability where an application receives input from an upstream component but does not properly neutralize code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource like a library, config file, or template. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code that gets executed when the resource is used. Consequences include accessing restricted data/files, bypassing access controls, executing unauthorized commands, hiding activities by avoiding logging, and compromising data integrity. Examples are given such as injecting PHP code by submitting it in a web form field that gets written directly to a PHP file. Mitigations focus on proper input and output validation and encoding.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-96 is a software weakness where input is inserted into executable code/files without properly neutralizing code syntax 
* This could allow arbitrary unauthorized code execution when the executable resource is used
* Consequences include file access, bypassing access controls, data integrity loss, hidden activities
* Occurs when software writes input directly to executable files like code, scripts, config files 
* Example with PHP web app writing user input to PHP file that can be executed
* Mitigations involve proper input and output validation, output encoding
