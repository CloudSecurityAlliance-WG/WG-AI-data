# Summary

The text describes CWE-322, a weakness related to key exchange without entity authentication. It explains that this weakness occurs when a product performs a key exchange with another entity without verifying the identity of that entity. This enables attackers to impersonate one of the entities by modifying traffic between them. Typically this involves a client contacting a malicious server impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores a failure, the attacker can then access sensitive information or credentials.
