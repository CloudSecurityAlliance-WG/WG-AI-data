# Summary

The document describes CWE-1357, a weakness related to the reliance on insufficiently trustworthy components in a product. It explains that modern products are often built by combining multiple smaller components, which may be from third party suppliers or open source. Each component should be sufficiently trusted to ensure the secure and reliable operation of the overall product. If a component is not trustworthy, it can introduce significant risks like unpatchable vulnerabilities, hidden malware functionality, inability to update components when needed, failure to meet hardware specifications leading to weaknesses, etc. There can be disagreement over whether a component is trustworthy enough since different stakeholders have different threat models and ways to assess trust. Choices often require tradeoffs between security, reliability, cost and other factors.

# Summary bullet points

* Modern products frequently combine components from third parties and open source into one product
* All components should be sufficiently trusted to ensure overall secure and reliable operation 
* Insufficiently trustworthy components introduce major risks like unpatchable vulnerabilities, hidden malware, lack of updateability
* Stakeholders disagree on what makes a component "trustworthy enough" based on differring perspectives
* Architectural choices require tradeoffs between multiple factors like security, reliability, cost
