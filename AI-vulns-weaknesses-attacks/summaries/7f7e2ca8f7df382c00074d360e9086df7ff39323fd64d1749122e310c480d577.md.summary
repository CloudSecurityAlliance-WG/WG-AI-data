Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry discusses the weakness of using single-factor authentication and recommends using multi-factor authentication instead. It explains that single-factor authentication, often just a password, is vulnerable to compromise. If an attacker obtains the password, they can gain full access. Multi-factor authentication adds extra layers of protection, so if one factor is compromised, the account is still protected. 

The entry provides examples of single-factor authentication in C and Java that just check if a password hash matches. It explains weaknesses around using plain text passwords and weak hashing algorithms. It also notes lack of salting passwords as an issue.

Potential mitigations include implementing multiple independent authentication schemes to reduce the risk if one method is compromised.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-308 discusses the weakness of single-factor authentication versus multi-factor 
* Single-factor using just a password is vulnerable if password is compromised
* Multi-factor authentication adds extra layers of protection if one factor compromised
* Examples in C and Java show just checking password hash 
* Weaknesses noted around plain text passwords, weak hashes, no salting
* Mitigation is to implement multiple authentication schemes
