# Summary

The text describes CWE-404, a common weakness related to improperly releasing resources before they can be reused. When an application fails to correctly shut down or release system resources like file handles or network connections, it can lead to availability issues, resource exhaustion, and denial of service vulnerabilities. Key aspects include:

- Resources like files, sockets, database connections, etc. need to be released after use to avoid resource leaks over time that degrade performance or cause failures. All exit points should release allocated resources.

- Matching allocation and deallocation functions should be used, like malloc/free and new/delete. All members of complex objects should be disposed of properly.  

- Not releasing resources properly can allow attackers to trigger resource exhaustion through malicious inputs or repeated requests. This can lead to denial of service conditions.

- Automated static and dynamic analysis tools can detect instances of improper resource release by modeling data and control flow to find missing releases. Manual testing can also trigger unusual conditions to test handling.

Proper resource management is critical for availability, performance efficiency, and limiting denial of service vulnerabilities.

# Summary bullet points

* Resources like files, sockets, and database connections need to be correctly released after use to avoid resource exhaustion issues over time
* Failing to release resources at all exit points of functions can cause leaks - release must occur along all code paths
* Matching allocation/deallocation functions should be used like malloc/free and new/delete 
* Complex objects require disposing of all members properly, not just the object itself
* Attackers can exploit improper shutdown to trigger resource exhaustion and denial of service conditions
* Static and dynamic analysis tools can detect missing resource releases in code
* Proper resource lifecycle management is key for availability, performance, efficiency and security
