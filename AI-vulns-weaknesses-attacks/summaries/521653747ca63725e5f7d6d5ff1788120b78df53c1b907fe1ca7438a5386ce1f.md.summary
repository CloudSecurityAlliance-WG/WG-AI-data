Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The document describes CWE-587, a common weakness related to assigning a fixed address to a pointer in software code. It explains that using a fixed address is not portable across environments and platforms, making the code prone to crashes or vulnerabilites if exploited. The key points are:

- Assigning a pointer to a fixed memory address rather than null or 0 leaves code open to crashes or attackers exploiting expected addresses.

- This happens because the address may not be valid when ported across platforms, causing crashes.

- Attackers can also inject code at expected addresses or easily read/modify memory contents.

- It is prevalent in C, C++, C#, and Assembly languages.

- Potential mitigations include never setting a fixed pointer address.
