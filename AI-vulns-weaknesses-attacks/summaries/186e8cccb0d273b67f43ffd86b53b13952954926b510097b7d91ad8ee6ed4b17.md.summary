# Summary

The text describes the CWE-568 weakness in the Common Weakness Enumeration system. CWE-568 refers to a finalize() method in Java code that does not call super.finalize(). The Java Language Specification recommends that finalize() methods should call super.finalize() as a good practice. Failing to call super.finalize() can lead to quality degradation and incomplete cleanup. The mitigation is to call super.finalize() in the finalize() method implementation. Static analysis tools can also detect instances of this weakness. 

The text provides background on CWE-568, explains why it can cause problems in software, and gives guidance on resolving the issue. It is focused on secure Java coding practices.
