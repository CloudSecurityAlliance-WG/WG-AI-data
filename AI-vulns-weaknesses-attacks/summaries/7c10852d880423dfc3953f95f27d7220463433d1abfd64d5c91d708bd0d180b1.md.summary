Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Here is a summary and analysis of the content according to the prompt:

# Summary

The content describes a weakness called Signal Handler Race Condition (CWE-364) which occurs when a signal handler introduces a race condition due to the asynchronous nature of signal handlers. This can lead to corruption of product state or exploits such as denial of service or code execution. Common causes are: shared state between signal handlers and regular code, shared state between different signal handlers, use of non-reentrant functions like malloc/free within handlers, associating one handler with multiple signals, or calling a handler more than once unexpectedly. Protection mechanisms like avoiding shared state, adding synchronization, or disabling signals can help avoid issues.  

Example exploit scenarios are provided, like one handler being interrupted by another or a handler freeing memory while malloc is mid-operation, resulting in corruption. Potential consequences include data corruption, privilege escalation, crashes, or arbitrary code execution. Many real-world vulnerabilities have resulted from signal handler race conditions.

# Summary bullet points

* Signal handlers can introduce race conditions due to asynchronous execution
* Can lead to corrupted state, DoS, or code execution through memory corruption
* Causes include: shared state between handlers and main code, shared state between handlers, using non-reentrant functions like malloc/free, associating one handler with multiple signals, calling a handler more than once unexpectedly  
* Avoid shared state, add synchronization, disable signals during sensitive operations to help prevent issues
* Real-world exploits have corrupted state, gained root privileges, caused crashes
* Example shows one handler freeing memory while malloc is mid-operation, corrupting structures
