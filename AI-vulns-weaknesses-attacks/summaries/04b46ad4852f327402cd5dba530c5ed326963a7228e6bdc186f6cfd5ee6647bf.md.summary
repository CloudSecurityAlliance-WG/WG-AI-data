Message:  # Summary

The CWE-910 weakness describes the use of a file descriptor after it has been closed. This can lead to reading data from the wrong file, crashing the program, or other unexpected behavior since the reused file descriptor may reference a different file. After a descriptor is closed, it can be allocated again and point somewhere else entirely. Proper file handling requires tracking descriptor state to avoid errors.
