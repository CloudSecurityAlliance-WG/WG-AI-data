Message:  # Summary

The text discusses adversarial examples, which are malicious inputs sent to AI/ML systems with the intent to fool or mislead them. It explains how researchers were able to construct sunglasses that could trick image recognition systems into not properly recognizing faces. The text warns that if you have not threat modeled your AI/ML system and dependencies, you are likely at risk of adversarial attacks. It provides an example of how a malicious customer could insert a backdoor into a company's AI algorithm during training, allowing them to later reconstruct the algorithm for their own purposes. Overall, the text emphasizes the need to secure AI/ML systems against adversarial threats through practices like threat modeling.
