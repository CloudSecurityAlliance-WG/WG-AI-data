# Summary

The document describes CWE-595, a common weakness in software systems related to improperly comparing object references instead of object contents. This can lead to unexpected application behavior if equivalent objects are not detected as such. Examples are provided in Java showing improper use of the == operator to compare objects vs using the .equals() method. The key mitigation is to use .equals() for comparing object contents. This is important because == just checks if two object references point to the same object, not if the values of two distinct objects are equivalent.
