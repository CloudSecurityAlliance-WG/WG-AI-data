Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper protection of alternate paths that allow users to access restricted functionality or resources. It occurs when a product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths a user can take to bypass protections and restrictions. This enables attackers to bypass security controls by directly requesting access to files or functionality through a non-protected alternate path.

The weakness is categorized as a violation of secure design principles and can lead to privilege escalation, assuming a user's identity, or bypassing protection mechanisms. It is applicable across languages and platforms. Potential mitigations include employing defense-in-depth with layered access controls on all endpoints. Proper mediation across all alternate paths to restricted resources is needed.
