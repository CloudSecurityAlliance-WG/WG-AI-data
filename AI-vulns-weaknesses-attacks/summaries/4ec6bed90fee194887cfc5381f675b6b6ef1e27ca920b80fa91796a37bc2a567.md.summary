# Summary

The document describes CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision weakness. This weakness occurs when a protection mechanism relies too heavily on a single condition or object to make access control decisions. If that single factor is compromised, an attacker could gain privileged access while evading other checks. This is a violation of secure design principles and can enable attackers to hide their activities if they gain access. Examples are password-only authentication systems where an attacker only needs to steal the password to impersonate a user. Mitigations include using multi-factor authentication that relies on "something you know" and "something you have" to make access decisions.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-654 involves too much reliance on a single factor when making security decisions 
* This enables attackers to bypass other checks and controls if they compromise that single factor
* It violates secure design principles around proper compartmentalization and separation of privilege
* Password-only authentication is a common manifestation 
* Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users by stealing just one factor like a password
* Multi-factor authentication is a mitigation, using multiple factors to make decisions
