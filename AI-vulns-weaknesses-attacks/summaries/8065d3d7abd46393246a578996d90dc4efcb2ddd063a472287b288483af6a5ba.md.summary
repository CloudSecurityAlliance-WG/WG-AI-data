# Summary

This paper proposes a novel backdoor attack called "Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attacks" that hides the attack trigger during training and reveals it at test time to fool the model. The key ideas are:

- Generate poisoned data that looks natural, with correct labels, and no visible trigger. This is done by optimizing the poisoned images to be close to target images visually while being close to source images (patched with the secret trigger) in feature space. 

- The attack generalizes to unseen source images and random trigger locations by optimizing poisoned images to be close to the distribution of patched source images across locations and images.

- Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR10 show the attack fools models by pasting triggers on unseen images at test time, reducing accuracy from 98% to 40%, while maintaining high performance on clean images.

- The proposed attack is hidden and more practical than prior backdoor attacks. The poisoned data has correct labels and the trigger is kept secret until test time.

- Defenses based on spectral signatures or visually inspecting data fail against this attack.

# Summary bullet points

* Novel backdoor attack hides trigger during training and reveals it at test time to fool models
* Poisoned data optimized to look natural and have correct labels while being close to patched source images in feature space  
* Attack generalizes by optimizing poisoned images over distribution of patched source images and locations
* Reduces ImageNet and CIFAR10 model test accuracy from 98% to 40% by pasting secret trigger on unseen images
* More practical than prior attacks since trigger is hidden and poison data has correct labels
* Spectral signature defenses ineffective as poisoned data not separable from clean data
