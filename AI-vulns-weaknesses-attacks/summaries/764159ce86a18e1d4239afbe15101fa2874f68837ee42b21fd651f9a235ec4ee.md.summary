# Summary

The text describes CWE-1239, a weakness related to improper zeroization of hardware registers in integrated circuits. It explains that sensitive data like passwords and encryption keys can remain stored in hardware registers even after the hardware block is no longer actively being used. Without proper mechanisms to clear register contents when switching contexts or users, subsequent users of the hardware IP can access leftover sensitive data. The consequence is information disclosure that compromises confidentiality. Standards like FIPS 140-2 mandate clearing register contents through a process called zeroization. The text outlines in detail via some Verilog code examples how failure to zeroize intermediate data in hardware register files after use led to an information disclosure vulnerability in a cryptographic module. It also suggests mitigations like mandating zeroization policies and mechanisms to programmatically clear registers after use. Physically erasing digital data still risks partial data remanence.

# Summary bullet points

* CWE-1239 relates to not properly zeroizing sensitive data in hardware registers when changing contexts/users of hardware IPs
* Data like encryption keys can remain stored in registers local to hardware IP blocks even after active use
* Subsequent users of the hardware can access leftover sensitive data unless it was cleared out using zeroization mechanisms  
* Consequence is confidentiality breach through information disclosure
* Standards like FIPS 140-2 require zeroization to clear registers in crypto modules  
* Detailed Verilog code examples show vulnerability from lack of intermediate register file clearing
* Suggested mitigations include mandating zeroization policies and programmatic register clearing after use
* Physically erasing digital data risks partial data remanence
