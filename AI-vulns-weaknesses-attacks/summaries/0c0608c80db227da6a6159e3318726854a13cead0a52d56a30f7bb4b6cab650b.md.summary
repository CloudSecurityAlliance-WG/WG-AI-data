# Summary

The document discusses the weakness of using a one-way cryptographic hash function without also using a salt when hashing inputs like passwords. Not using a salt makes it easier for attackers to crack the hashes using rainbow table attacks. While adding a salt increases the difficulty somewhat, other adaptive hash functions like bcrypt, scrypt, and PBKDF2 are more effective at preventing brute force attacks. The document recommends using these adaptive hash functions, or if those cannot be implemented, generate a random salt for each password hash. It explains that salts alone provide limited protection against targeted attacks against individual password hashes. 

# Summary bullet points

* Using one-way hashes without salts to store passwords allows easier cracking with rainbow tables
* Salts make dictionary attacks slightly harder but still allow brute force attacks 
* Adaptive hash functions like bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2 are most effective by increasing computing overhead
* If those can't be used, generate random salt per password hash, although limited protection vs targeted attacks
* Other more minor recommendations like proper implementation, not using weak hashes like MD5/SHA1
