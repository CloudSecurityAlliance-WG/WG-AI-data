# Summary

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-1295 discusses the weakness of debug messages revealing unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information. Debug messages are intended to help troubleshoot issues by revealing internal system state. However, they can also unintentionally expose information that could help an attacker gain insights into vulnerabilities or otherwise sensitive data. This violates the security principle of obscurity and makes systems more vulnerable. Examples are given such as debug messages revealing system topology information beyond what is needed to respond to a request, or showing the actual stored password in a message instead of just granting or denying access. The solution is to ensure debug messages only reveal information necessary to serve their purpose and no more.

# Summary bullet points

* Debug messages help troubleshoot issues but can reveal sensitive unnecessary info
* Violates security principle of obscurity, gives attackers insights into system
* Examples: showing system topology or actual stored passwords unintentionally 
* Solution is to limit info in debug messages only to what is necessary
