# Summary

The content describes the weakness CWE-626: Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte), which occurs when a product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components. This can lead to unexpected behavior when crossing representations that treat null bytes differently. It is frequently used to enable path traversal attacks or bypass regular expression checks. Potential mitigations include removing null bytes from all incoming strings.
