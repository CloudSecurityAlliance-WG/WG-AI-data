Message:  # Summary

On-chip debug and test interfaces like JTAG provide access to sensitive internal registers and test modes. If access control is not properly implemented for these interfaces, attackers can bypass protections and access sensitive data or execute unauthorized code. Proper authentication and authorization should be required before granting debug access. Debug ports should also be disabled or hidden when not actively in use.  

Key aspects in summary:

- On-chip debug/test interfaces expose sensitive internal device data and controls
- Improper access control allows attackers to bypass protections via debug interfaces  
- Proper authentication and authorization required for secure debug access
- Disable or hide debug ports when not in use to prevent attacks

# Summary bullet points

* On-chip debug and test interfaces like JTAG provide access to sensitive internal device data and controls
* If improper access control to these interfaces, attackers can bypass protections and access sensitive information/code
* Lack of access control allows unauthorized debug commands and data access
* Enables malicious activities like unauthorized code execution or data modification
* Proper authentication and authorization should control access to debug interfaces
* Debug ports should be disabled or hidden when not actively in use
* Manufacturers should implement cryptographic authentication for debug access
* Restrict number of incorrect authentication attempts to prevent brute force attacks
