Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of improper control of a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release. Resources often have explicit instructions on how they should be created, used and destroyed. When code does not follow these instructions, it can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially exploitable states. Even without explicit instructions, various principles are expected to be adhered to regarding resource lifetime management. This weakness can manifest in many specific ways, as indicated by the various child weaknesses listed.
