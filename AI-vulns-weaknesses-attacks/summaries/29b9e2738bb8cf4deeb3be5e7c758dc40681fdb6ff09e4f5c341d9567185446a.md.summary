Message:  # Summary

Adversaries may search publicly available research to identify targets and tailor attacks against an organization's machine learning systems. The research can reveal details on how and where machine learning is used within a victim organization. Knowing the underlying model architectures allows adversaries to craft more realistic proxy models to evade defenses. Research materials that may be searched include academic papers, pre-print repositories, and technical blogs authored by the victim organization's employees.
