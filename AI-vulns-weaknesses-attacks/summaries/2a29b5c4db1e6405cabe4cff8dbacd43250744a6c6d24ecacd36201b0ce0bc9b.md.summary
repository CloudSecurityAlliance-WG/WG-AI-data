Message:  # Summary

The CWE-286 weakness describes incorrect user management within a product or system. Specifically, it refers to situations where users are assigned to incorrect permission groups, resulting in unintended access rights to sensitive objects. This can allow attackers to gain elevated privileges and carry out unauthorized actions. The weakness stems from flaws in the architecture and design or implementation phases. It can lead to varying technical impacts depending on the context. Some real-world examples include a containerization product failing to record supplementary group IDs properly and an OS assigning a user to the privileged wheel group. Mitigations involve properly managing user permissions and access controls.
