Status: SUCCESS
Message:  # Summary

The CWE entry describes the weakness of including undocumented features or "chicken bits" in a device that can create unauthorized entry points for attackers. These hidden interfaces are intended for debugging and testing but can be exploited to bypass security protections or gain elevated privileges. The summary specifically calls out secure boot protections being vulnerable to the weakness.

# Summary bullet points

* Undocumented "chicken bits" or special access features can create vulnerabilities by exposing interfaces intended only for manufacturers
* Attackers can exploit these to bypass protections like secure boot or gain privileged system access
* If implemented, these features should be disabled in production devices 
* All interfaces should be properly documented
* Example shows attackers using UART debug interface with special commands to read/write memory and execute code
