# Summary

The document describes CWE-552, a weakness related to files or directories being accessible to unauthorized external parties. This can happen with web, FTP or other servers that store sensitive files without proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access them. It also can occur with misconfigured cloud storage. The consequences include potential reading or modification of confidential or sensitive files.  

Some key mitigations are to properly configure access controls on servers and cloud storage to restrict access as needed. Tools like static analysis security testing can also detect instances of this weakness in code.
