# Summary

The document describes CWE-1392, a common weakness enumeration related to the use of default credentials like passwords or cryptographic keys in products. It explains that using defaults is common to simplify manufacturing and installation but poses authentication vulnerabilities if admins don't change them, allowing attackers easy access across organizations. The weakness enables gaining privileges or assuming identities. An example is a 2022 study finding OT products insecure by design, including through default credentials. Mitigations include prohibiting defaults, forcing admin credential changes on installation, and having admins change credentials.
